**Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**\
We were laughing in the kitchen,\
Sunlight dancing on the floor.\
Plans were blooming like the garden,\
We had room to dream of more.

Then the silence came unspoken,\
Like a shadow through the glass.\
Twelve weeks in, the world was broken,\
And the joy began to pass.

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
I held the hope like petals,\
Pressed between the pages worn.\
But nature writes in riddles,\
And some stories are stillborn.

**\[Chorus\]**\
In the sunset in the field,\
I lay down what couldn't grow.\
Not forgotten, just concealed,\
In the soil where love still flows.\
You were real, you were mine,\
In a moment, in a sign---\
And I carry you in light,\
Through the sunset in the field.

**\[Verse 2\]**\
I see mothers in the market,\
Hear the laughter in the park.\
And I smile, but there\'s a quiet\
That still flickers in the dark.

I'm not broken, just reshaped,\
By the ache that made me strong.\
And I speak so others know\
They're not alone for long.

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
We name the pain with courage,\
We let the silence sing.\
And in the hush of healing,\
We feel the fluttering.

**\[Chorus\]**\
In the sunset in the field,\
I lay down what couldn't grow.\
Not forgotten, just concealed,\
In the soil where love still flows.\
You were real, you were mine,\
In a moment, in a sign---\
And I carry you in light,\
Through the sunset in the field.

**\[Bridge\]**\
If I could pass a whisper\
To the hearts that feel this loss,\
It would say: you're not invisible,\
You're not alone, you're not lost.

**\[Final Chorus\]**\
In the sunset in the field,\
We remember what was true.\
Not erased, just gently healed,\
By the love that carries through.\
You were real, you were mine,\
In a moment, in a sign---\
And I carry you in light,\
Through the sunset in the field.
