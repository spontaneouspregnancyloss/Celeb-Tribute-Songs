**Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1\]**

April light, a quiet joy,

A test, a truth, a whispered boy.

We told the world too soon, too bright,

A miracle child in morning light.

But silence came like falling glass,

A dream too fragile, too fast to last.

We held the hope with trembling hands,

And watched it slip like desert sands.

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**

I wanted you, I needed you,

In a world that told me no.

Thirteen years of locked-up dreams,

Now freedom let me grow.

**\[Chorus\]**

We lost our miracle baby,

But not the love we gave.

In the hush of early sorrow,

We found the strength to stay.

You were real, you were ours,

In the bloom before the fall---

And I carry you in silence,

Where the miracle still calls.

**\[Verse 2\]**

They said I couldn't choose my path,

A voice restrained, a faded laugh.

But I broke the chains, I claimed the sky,

And dared to dream, and dared to try.

A month of joy, a flash of pain,

A heart that beats in memory's name.

We questioned if we spoke too soon,

But love can't wait beneath the moon.

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**

I wanted you, I needed you,

In a world that told me no.

But even in this aching loss,

I feel your gentle glow.

**\[Chorus\]**

We lost our miracle baby,

But not the love we gave.

In the hush of early sorrow,

We found the strength to stay.

You were real, you were ours,

In the bloom before the fall---

And I carry you in silence,

Where the miracle still calls.

**\[Bridge\]**

I speak for those who've felt this ache,

Who've smiled through tears they couldn't fake.

You're not alone, you're not erased,

Your love is still embraced.

**\[Final Chorus\]**

We lost our miracle baby,

But not the love we gave.

In the hush of early sorrow,

We found the strength to stay.

You were real, you were ours,

In the bloom before the fall---

And I carry you in silence,

Where the miracle still calls.
