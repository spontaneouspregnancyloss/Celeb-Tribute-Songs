## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
Three hearts began to grow,  
A miracle I held close.  
But one slipped away too soon,  
A silence no one knows.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I sang through the sorrow,  
Smiled through the pain.  
But deep inside,  
I whispered their name.

**[Chorus]**  
One heartbeat lost,  
Still echoes in mine.  
A love that never faded,  
A soul that crossed the line.

**[Verse 2]**  
It’s life, they say,  
But it’s more than words.  
It’s lullabies unspoken,  
It’s dreams unheard.

**[Bridge]**  
I carry you in every note,  
In every breath I sing.

**[Outro]**  
One heartbeat lost,  
Still part of everything.
```
