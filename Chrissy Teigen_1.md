## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
We named you Jack,  
Before we said goodbye.  
The room was full of love,  
And then it was just why.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I held your hand,  
Though you couldn’t stay.  
I told the world,  
But not what I couldn’t say.

**[Chorus]**  
Kind of deep pain,  
You only hear about.  
Now I know it,  
Inside and out.

**[Verse 2]**  
It wasn’t just a loss,  
It was a choice to live.  
I didn’t know the words,  
Till I had none left to give.

**[Bridge]**  
I felt silly,  
But truth takes time.

**[Outro]**  
Kind of deep pain,  
Still part of mine.
```
