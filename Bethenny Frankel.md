  ("two little girls in rain boots").

  if it's meant to be, it will happen.

**Draft 1 --- Narrative arc (timeline)**

**Verse 1**\
Forty-one, spotting, a room gone still.\
The word lands hard, I'm told to rest.\
Keep it quiet, keep it small,\
count the hours, breathe through the nausea.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Then a heartbeat like a tiny drum---\
one bright dinner, we let ourselves believe.\
Next day: the shiver, the chair, the blood,\
a cab, a screen, a search gone quiet.

**Chorus**\
I ask the question no one wants to say,\
hear the answer no one wants to hear.\
Hands on my ribs, I try to own the air---\
not my fault, they tell me. I try to believe.

**Verse 2**\
Clinic light, folded linens, paper gown,\
sign the form, count backward, wake to hush.\
We walk outside and order something simple,\
because sometimes grief comes with a table for two.

**Bridge**\
Relief arrives uninvited, brings its cousin, guilt.\
Days later, a call: the chart says "girl."\
I see rain boots by the door, two pairs,\
and the picture breaks me clean in half.

**Chorus/Outro**\
I hold my child, I choose my quiet,\
I loosen my grip on what must be.\
I won't turn life into a try-hard race---\
if it finds me, I'll open the door.

**Draft 2 --- Vignette/imagistic (built from theme map)**

**Verse 1**\
Makeup chair, winter light,\
a pulse I thought I'd keep.\
Paper wristband, whispered names,\
I practice how to breathe.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Room goes quiet, gel goes cold,\
someone circles empty space.\
I lift the ceiling with my chest,\
waiting for a sound that doesn't come.

**Chorus**\
There's a hallway where the strong go soft,\
a clinic where the brave go small.\
I sign my name like stitching skin,\
walk out and order something warm.

**Verse 2**\
Relief taps once, guilt holds on,\
I let them in and still feel wrong.\
Ten days later, one word---girl---\
and rain boots multiply by two.

**Bridge**\
I talk to no one, talk to everyone,\
break the pact of staying silent.\
It wasn't on me, I say,\
and still I check my ribs for blame.

**Outro (Hook)**\
I keep my child close and my calendar loose,\
no stopwatch on the heart's repair.\
If life is coming, it will find me---\
door unlocked, a light left there.

Got it --- thank you for flagging that 🙏. You're absolutely right: the
earlier drafts leaned toward plain storytelling and didn't consistently
apply **slant rhyme or lyrical cadence**, which makes them read more
like prose than songs.

Here's how I'll fix this for **Bethenny Frankel's miscarriage lyrics**,
while staying fully aligned with her *own first-hand accounts* (as
traced from Deliverable A evidence).

**Approach to Repair:**

- Keep every line grounded in what she has *actually said*.

- Use **light/slant rhyme** so it flows musically (ABAB or AABC
  patterns), while still natural.

- Preserve her style: candid, witty, emotionally intelligent, but not
  sensationalized.

- Ensure each section (verse, chorus, bridge) has a musical rhythm that
  matches her suggested style (*spoken word / acoustic storytelling with
  a pop-theatrical edge*).

**🎶 Draft 1 --- Narrative Arc (with rhyme)**

**Verse 1**\
I thought I had more time to see,\
Life was rushing ahead of me.\
At forty-one, I knew the cost,\
Joy and fear for what was lost.

It was brief, it slipped away,\
No choice in how the cards would play.

Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\

Doctors' words were calm, direct,\
Life's a script you don't expect.\
I stood steady, though I bled,\
Grateful still for what I had.

But I choose to live each day.

**Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Bridge**\
I speak my truth, I own my part,\
No silence weighing on my heart.\
Sharing sorrow makes it real,\
But honesty's the way I heal.

Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Verse 1**\
White walls whisper, steady light,\
Time stood still on a sleepless night.\

A fleeting story left untold.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Life is timing, sharp and kind,\

Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

Age and numbers marked my years,\
Mixed with laughter, laced with tears.\
I don't regret the path I choose,\
Even love comes dressed as bruise.

A truth you face, no pause, rewind.

**Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

**Bridge**\
To say it out loud, it makes me whole,\
Honesty speaking what silence stole.\
Not broken, but wiser, I remain,\
Love still lingers after pain.

Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.
