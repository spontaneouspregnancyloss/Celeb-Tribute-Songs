**Bethenny Frankel_Lyrics to Song**

**ðŸŽ¶ Draft 1 --- Narrative Arc (with rhyme)**

**Verse 1**\
I thought I had more time to see,\
Life was rushing ahead of me.\
At forty-one, I knew the cost,\
Joy and fear for what was lost.

**Pre-Chorus**\
It was brief, it slipped away,\
No choice in how the cards would play.

**Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Verse 2**\
Doctors' words were calm, direct,\
Life's a script you don't expect.\
I stood steady, though I bled,\
Grateful still for what I had.

**Pre-Chorus**\
It was brief, it slipped away,\
But I choose to live each day.

**Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Bridge**\
I speak my truth, I own my part,\
No silence weighing on my heart.\
Sharing sorrow makes it real,\
But honesty's the way I heal.

**Final Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.


**ðŸŽ¶ Draft 2 --- Vignette / Imagistic (with rhyme)**

**Verse 1**\
White walls whisper, steady light,\
Time stood still on a sleepless night.\
A fragile hope I couldn't hold,\
A fleeting story left untold.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Life is timing, sharp and kind,\
A truth you face, no pause, rewind.

**Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

**Verse 2**\
Age and numbers marked my years,\
Mixed with laughter, laced with tears.\
I don't regret the path I choose,\
Even love comes dressed as bruise.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Life is timing, sharp and kind,\
A truth you face, no pause, rewind.

**Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

**Bridge**\
To say it out loud, it makes me whole,\
Honesty speaking what silence stole.\
Not broken, but wiser, I remain,\
Love still lingers after pain.

**Final Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.
