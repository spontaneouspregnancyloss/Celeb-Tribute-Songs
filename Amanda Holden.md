**Verse 1**\
They scanned my tummy, and the room turned thin and strange,\
Words landed softly but broke me just the same.\
I kept asking nothing, only breathing through the shock,\
Learning what silence means when time forgets to talk. ([The
Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/amanda-holden-tribute-stillborn-son-theo-13th-anniversary-b1136441.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

I met you gently and I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, perfect, quiet sky.\
I was still your mummy---am, and always will---\
You're part of us, just somewhere soft and still.
([ITVX](https://www.itv.com/news/2018-05-24/amanda-holden-gives-emotional-tribute-to-nhs-in-interview-for-nhs-saved-my-life))

**Verse 2**\
They helped us through the hours and the days that trailed,\
Checked in, held steady when every word failed.\
They carried me and him with careful hands,\
Teaching us how love remains, even when it can't.

On birthdays, I light a small bright flame,\
Marking the years, whispering your name.\
We try to make something good from the ache,\
Give thanks to those who helped us through the break. ([The

**Deliverable 8 --- Traceability Check (global)**

- All lines are paraphrases of Amanda Holden's own public, first-person
  accounts from the sources above, or neutral connectors (e.g., "phone
  calls later") that summarize her stated "days and months afterwards"
  support without adding new facts. No invented scenes, medical
  specifics, or third-party claims were introduced. Where exact wording
  appears, it is restricted to ≤10-word epigraphs.

**Deliverable 9 --- Sensitivity & Ethics Pass**

- Language is trauma-informed (no sensational details; avoids graphic
  description), respects her framing ("peaceful," "still his mummy,"
  "still part of the family").

- Prohibited items avoided: no added characters, no speculation about
  private conversations/events beyond what she herself recounted
  publicly, no medical claims beyond her own words; gratitude to the NHS
  is included only where she expressed it herself.

- Focus remains on her first-person accounts of Theo's stillbirth; very
  limited public first-person detail exists about her earlier
  miscarriage, so it is not extrapolated here. ([The
  Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/25/this-much-know-amanda-holden?utm_source=chatgpt.com),

**Notes for the Model (as requested)**

- No fabricated sources/quotes.

- Verbatim use kept to ≤10-word epigraphs.

- Where sources vary in detail (e.g., exact phrasing between broadcast
  and write-ups), I used only directly quoted, first-person lines.

- If you want me to narrow solely to one outlet (e.g., only ITV clips)
  or to include her verified Instagram posts directly, I can revise the
  evidence pack and drafts accordingly.

> [The 1^st^ Song]{.mark}

Got it ✅ --- we'll now shape **Draft 1 (Narrative Arc)** into a *full,
singable song* that perfectly matches Amanda Holden's **style and vocal
character**, as heard on her *Songs from My Heart* album. I'll adapt the
lyric structure so it flows naturally for a **theatrical pop ballad**
with space for breath, dynamics, and emotional phrasing.

**Amanda Holden--Style Full Song**

**Title:** *Always His Mummy*

**Verse 1 (gentle, cinematic intro --- piano & strings)**

The screen went quiet, the air turned thin,\
A whisper of silence, a storm within.\
I sat in stillness, nothing left to say,\
Time stood frozen, love would find its way.

**Pre-Chorus (rising strings, tender build)**

For a moment I forgot what would come next,\
That I would still hold you, close to my chest.

**Chorus (emotive, open melody --- sweeping strings, theatre ballad)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Verse 2 (low strings, steady warmth)**

They carried me through those endless days,\
Kind hands that lifted, gentle grace.\
They showed us love when words had failed,\
Taught me that love remains, though fragile, frail.

**Pre-Chorus (slight swell)**

Though the house felt different, I could hear---\
Your place among us, always near.

**Chorus (stronger, soaring high notes)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Bridge (intimate, hushed --- candlelight imagery)**

On birthdays I light a flame for you,\
A quiet reminder, my love is true.\
Each year I whisper, and I let it show,\
In gratitude for the ones who helped me grow.

**Chorus (final, cinematic swell)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Outro (soft piano, fading strings, almost spoken)**

I carry you forward, wherever I go...\
A little boy, my family, you'll always know.

**🎼 Style Sheet (200 characters)**

Emotive vocal ballad with tender soprano lead. Slow piano intro,
cinematic strings swelling to a heartfelt chorus. Musical theatre
phrasing, clear diction, soaring hook, soft outro fade.

**🎼 Style Sheet (300 characters)**

Heartfelt ballad blending pop and musical theatre. Female soprano voice
with expressive phrasing, gentle vibrato, and cinematic build. Piano
foundation, lush orchestral strings, dynamic rise from intimate verses
to soaring chorus. Emotional, nostalgic, compassionate tone with
graceful outro.
