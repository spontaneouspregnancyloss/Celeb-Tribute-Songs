**Verse 1**\
They scanned my tummy, and the room turned thin and strange,\
Words landed softly but broke me just the same.\
I kept asking nothing, only breathing through the shock,\
Learning what silence means when time forgets to talk. ([The

**Pre-Chorus**\
For a heartbeat I forgot what would come next,\
That I would still meet you, face to chest. ([The

**Chorus**\
I met you gently and I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, perfect, quiet sky.\
I was still your mummy---am, and always will---\
You're part of us, just somewhere soft and still.

**Verse 2**\
They helped us through the hours and the days that trailed,\
Checked in, held steady when every word failed.\
They carried me and him with careful hands,\
Teaching us how love remains, even when it can't.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Home felt different, but your place stayed clear---\
A space we speak to, even when not here.

**Bridge**\
On birthdays, I light a small bright flame,\
Marking the years, whispering your name.\
We try to make something good from the ache,\
Give thanks to those who helped us through the break. ([The

**Outro**\
I carry you forward in everything we do---\
A little boy, our family, forever including you.
