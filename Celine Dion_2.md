## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
Three stars in the sky,  
One faded from view.  
I held you in silence,  
Though I never knew you.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The music played on,  
But something was gone.

**[Chorus]**  
Triplet sky, missing light,  
Still I sing through the night.  
You were here, you were mine,  
Even if just for a time.

**[Verse 2]**  
No one sees the empty space,  
But I feel it every day.

**[Bridge]**  
You were part of the song,  
Even if you couldn’t stay.

**[Outro]**  
Triplet sky, I remember,  
In my own quiet way.
```
