Song Draft 2 --- "Little Light"**

*(vignette/imagistic approach, styled for Alanis Morissette)*

**\[Verse 1 -- intimate vocal, acoustic + subtle cello drone\]**\
A calendar dotted with starts that didn't hold\
Files on the table, papers soft from being told\
Grief with fear, a tandem I learned to wear\
Wanting three, wondering if I'd ever get there

**\[Pre-Chorus -- bass + rimshot drums enter\]**\
I kept moving, prayer in one hand, steps in the other\
Showing up anyway, one day after another

**\[Chorus -- full band, jagged guitar + violin swell\]**\
Through surprises, devastations, I watched a small light\
Flicker in downpour, stubborn and slight\
An optimist who cries, but I don't let go\
That little ember keeps saying: try once more

**\[Verse 2 -- cello carries low melody, guitar fingerpicked\]**\
Investigations with tentacles reaching through the dark\
Rabbit holes for answers, every lead, every mark\
Doctors smiled at the thickness I brought\
From home remedies to scripts --- I tried the lot

**\[Pre-Chorus -- stronger drum hits, vocal rise\]**\
I kept moving, prayer in one hand, steps in the other\
Showing up anyway, one day after another

**\[Chorus -- layered harmonies, violin doubles vocal line\]**\
Through surprises, devastations, I watched a small light\
Flicker in downpour, stubborn and slight\
An optimist who cries, but I don't let go\
That little ember keeps saying: try once more

**\[Bridge -- stripped back, cello + soft piano under voice\]**\
Not the ideal story, one loss turned molar\
The room grew quiet, the hallway grew colder\
Still, trust kept working --- a pilot low-glow\
I breathed with it gently, I let it flow

**\[Chorus -- explosive, full band + violin soaring counterline\]**\
Through surprises, devastations, I watched a small light\
Flicker in downpour, stubborn and slight\
An optimist who cries, but I don't let go\
That little ember keeps saying: try once more

**\[Outro -- cello + acoustic fade, whispered vocal echo\]**\
If the sky breaks open, I'll stand in that rain\
Chasing, praying, showing up again\
Loss taught me rhythm, I hum it with care\
A small steady signal: still carried there

**Verse 1**\
A calendar dotted with starts that didn't hold,\
Files on the table, papers soft from being told,\
Grief with fear, a tandem I learned to wear,\
Wanting three, wondering if I'd ever get there.

**Pre-Chorus**\
I kept moving --- prayer in one hand, steps in the other,\
Showing up anyway, one day after another.

**Chorus**\
Through surprises, devastations, I watched a small light,\
Flicker in downpour, stubborn and slight,\
An optimist who cries, but I don't let go,\
That little ember keeps saying: try once more.

**Verse 2**\
Investigation with tentacles, reaching through the dark,\
Rabbit holes for answers, every lead, every mark,\
Doctors smile at the thickness I bring,\
From home remedies to scripts --- everything.

**Bridge**\
Not the ideal story, one loss turned molar,\
The room grew quiet; the hallway felt colder,\
Still, trust kept working --- a pilot low-glow,\
I breathed with it gently, and let it slow.

**Outro**\
If the sky breaks open, I'll stand in that rain,\
Chasing, praying, showing up again,\
Loss taught me the rhythm; I hum it with care,\
A small, steady signal, I keep it there.

**[Pilot Light (Female Vocals)]{.mark}**

[**\[Verse 1 -- low vocal, acoustic + light drums\]**\
Between the first and second, we stopped, then started again\
I kept the wish for three while bracing for the bend\
Challenges gathered, miscarriages taught me to doubt\
I said it out loud --- maybe it won't work out\
Grief sat beside fear; we learned how to share\
I carried them softly, like smoke in the air]{.mark}

[**\[Pre-Chorus -- tension builds, bass enters\]**\
I chased and I prayed for a pregnancy to stay\
Every step, I showed up anyway]{.mark}

[**\[Chorus -- full band, layered vocals, jagged guitar\]**\
Chasing and showing up, through surprise and devastation\
A little trust-light flickered through the rain's duration\
Optimist with tears, but the flame kept near\
Small as a star I could cradle here]{.mark}

[**\[Verse 2 -- return to softer tone, then build\]**\
I sent out investigations with all their reaching threads\
Down every rabbit hole, through files an inch thick\
Doctors laughed kindly at the weight of what I'd read\
From home cures to scripts, I kept every brick\
Learning and loss braided tight with time\
Persevering became the meter, became the line]{.mark}

[**\[Pre-Chorus -- repeat, slightly higher register\]**\
I chased and I prayed for a pregnancy to stay\
Every step, I showed up anyway]{.mark}

[**\[Chorus -- heavier drums, background harmonies\]**\
Chasing and showing up, through surprise and devastation\
A little trust-light flickered through the rain's duration\
Optimist with tears, but the flame kept near\
Small as a star I could cradle here]{.mark}

[**\[Bridge -- stripped, piano/synth + voice front\]**\
Not the ideal path, one loss turned molar\
The plan went sideways, the seasons grew slower\
Still the pilot kept burning in weather\
Trust as an ember we guarded together]{.mark}

[**\[Chorus -- big, repeat with ad-libs, final lift\]**\
Chasing and showing up, through surprise and devastation\
A little trust-light flickered through the rain's duration\
Optimist with tears, but the flame kept near\
Small as a star I could cradle here]{.mark}

[**\[Outro -- fade on acoustic + harmony echo\]**\
So I show up again, in the dark or the clear\
Chasing, praying, holding space for the fear\
If the downpour returns, I'll keep the flame near\
A small steady signal: I'm Still Carried here]{.mark}
