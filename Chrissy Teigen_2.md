## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
There’s a room in my heart,  
With your name on the wall.  
I visit it often,  
Though no one sees at all.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I light a candle,  
I speak your name.

**[Chorus]**  
Jack’s room, quiet and warm,  
Built from love, not form.  
You were here, you are mine,  
Even if just for a time.

**[Verse 2]**  
I didn’t understand,  
Till the silence spoke.

**[Bridge]**  
I chose life,  
But I still broke.

**[Outro]**  
Jack’s room, always open,  
In the heart I’ve never closed.
```
