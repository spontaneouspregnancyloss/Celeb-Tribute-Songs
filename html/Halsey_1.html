**🎼 Song 1: “Three Before Twenty-Four” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “I miscarried three times before my 24th birthday.”

**[Verse 1]**  
I was twenty, bleeding backstage,  
A towel between my legs.  
I sang through the silence,  
While my body begged.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Three before twenty-four,  
And still I stood.

**[Chorus]**  
Three before twenty-four,  
But I kept the mic.  
Three before twenty-four,  
Still chasing light.

**[Verse 2]**  
My abortion saved my life,  
And gave my son his chance.

**[Bridge]**  
I broke,  
But I danced.

**[Outro]**  
Three before twenty-four,  
Still in the trance.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Three before twenty-four / Still chasing light”_
