**🎵 Song 2: _“Murder Scene”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
I walked into the hospital,  
Bleeding through the seams.  
The doctor said, “You’ve gone white,”  
I said, “I’m having a miscarriage, it seems.”

**[Chorus]**  
It looked like a murder scene,  
But it was just me.  
Trying to hold on,  
To what couldn’t be.

**[Verse 2]**  
I didn’t tell Jamie,  
I didn’t tell my mum.  
I thought I was selfish,  
For wanting one more son.

**[Bridge]**  
I nearly died,  
But I survived.  
I speak now,  
So others feel alive.

**[Outro]**  
It looked like a murder scene,  
But it was love unseen.
