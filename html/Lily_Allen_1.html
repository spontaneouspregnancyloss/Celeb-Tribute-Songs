Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
I used to hum your name in secret  
Folded clothes you’d never wear  
Built a world around your heartbeat  
Dreamt of laughter in the air

**Pre-Chorus**  
The room was quiet, too quiet to bear  
No cry, no breath, just sterile care  
They said your name, I held it tight  
A mother born in silent night

**Chorus**  
You never cried, but I still hear you  
George, I knew you  
In every dream, in every sigh  
You live where memory won’t die

**Verse 2**  
I walked out with empty arms  
But full of something I can’t name  
They called it loss, I called it love  
A bond untouched by blame

**Pre-Chorus**  
I see you in your sisters’ eyes  
In quiet moments, lullabies  
You never stayed, but you remain  
In every joy, in every pain

**Chorus**  
You never cried, but I still hear you  
George, I knew you  
In every dream, in every sigh  
You live where memory won’t die

**Bridge**  
I don’t think grief is generous  
But it’s the only thing that grew  
From the space you left behind  
George, I knew you

**Outro**  
So I sing you soft into the blue  
George, I knew you  
Still carried, still true  
George, I knew you
