**üéµ Song 1: _‚ÄúFive in Nine‚Äù_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Five losses in nine long years,  
Each one carved through silent tears.  
We named them in our hearts alone,  
Souls we never got to know.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It tore us open, left us raw,  
No comfort in the waiting room law.  
We held each other through the night,  
Grief wrapped tight in morning light.

**[Chorus]**  
Five in nine, still we rise,  
Five in nine, through the cries.  
Love survives, even when it breaks,  
Even when the body aches.

**[Verse 2]**  
Blood transfusions, hospital lights,  
Prayers whispered in sleepless nights.  
We learned to speak, we learned to bend,  
We learned that healing has no end.

**[Bridge]**  
We take care of each other now,  
Even when we don‚Äôt know how.

**[Outro]**  
Five in nine, still we try,  
Five in nine, no goodbye.
