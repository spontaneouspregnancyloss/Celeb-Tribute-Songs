**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
Edgy pop-rock ballad—sharp guitar sting, driving piano, dynamic vocals. Rhymes like “body/miscarry” or “pain/train.” Bold yet tender; unapologetic in pain and hope.

**300 Character Style**  
This P!nk-flavored vignette blends her fierce energy and emotional rawness. Vocals ride a steady backbeat—verses highlight body betrayal and shame, pre-chorus builds to defiance, chorus blistering and anthemic. Bridge softens to reflection, outro closes on strength reclaimed.

**Lyrics**  
[Verse 1]  
At seventeen, my body whispered betrayal,  
a gymnast’s strength turned into a silent fail.  
I was ready for you—but found only blame,  
every heartbeat gone but the shame remained.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Heavy in flesh, I carried scars unsung,  
body broken, truth unsaid on my tongue.

[Chorus (Hook)]  
My scars told secrets my mouth wouldn’t dare to speak,  
but I ripped off shame, found strength in being weak.  
So I scream what hurts, I own what breaks me,  
writing through the pain, nothing stops what shapes me.

[Verse 2]  
I’m no stranger to loss—there’s been more than one,  
a broken chain, but still I’ve spun.  
I’ve hated my body, its failures and its lies,  
but I claw back each time, refusing my demise.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Therapy’s mirror showed blind spots in my fight—  
uncomfortable truths became the fuel for light.

[Bridge]  
I laugh when I can’t breathe and cry when I laugh too hard,  
self-deprecating jokes guard my pulled-apart heart.  
I write the painful s---, I bare what scares me most—  
Because the person I judge sharpest was the one who needed hope.

[Outro]  
Still I stand—raw, unashamed, and brave,  
my body’s truth, the anthem I’ll save.
