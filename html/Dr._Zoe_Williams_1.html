**🎼 Song 1: “Live On Air” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “One miscarriage happened while presenting live on air.”

**[Verse 1]**  
I smiled for the camera,  
While my world fell apart.  
Live on air,  
With a broken heart.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
No one knew,  
But I carried the weight.

**[Chorus]**  
Live on air,  
Grief behind the glare.  
I kept going,  
Though I wasn’t okay.

**[Verse 2]**  
Two losses, quiet and unseen,  
But talking helped me breathe.

**[Bridge]**  
You know someone going through this,  
Even if they don’t say.

**[Outro]**  
Live on air,  
Still healing every day.
