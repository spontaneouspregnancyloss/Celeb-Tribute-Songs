### Song Description

This song draws from Sanya Richards-Ross’s first-person recounting of her traumatic miscarriage: the ambulance rush, blood transfusion, telling her son. It illustrates fear turned into perspective, her reconnection with motherhood, and renewed identity. The tone remains grounded, reflective, and quietly hopeful—without speculation or added characters. The arrangement mirrors her strength and calm clarity.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1 — female vocals, gentle piano and soft guitar]  
I heard “not growing” at week seven, then the world narrowed—  
Rushed from calm to unknown in a hospital ride,  
Blood slipping away before strength found me,  
Alone in that tunnel, fear spoke too loudly.

[Pre-Chorus — subtle strings join piano]  
It was very, very, very scary—echoes in silence,  
You’d already let your heart pour forward—and grief found its foothold.

[Chorus / Hook — full vocal swell, warm acoustic support]  
You opened your heart—and I found strength in the scar;  
In that emptiness, clarity whispered what love declared—  
Perspective blooms in the quiet after the fall,  
You opened your heart—and I found strength in the scar.

[Verse 2 — steady vocal, guitar warmth returns]  
Every night’s prayer—“please let us have a healthy baby”—  
Your plea broke through the hush I thought I could hold;  
I told Deuce-y the truth and watched a little heart break,  
Yet in that fracturing, I felt purpose rise again.

[Bridge — piano alone, voice tender]  
That moment changed everything—it cracked open my soul,  
Made me see how much I needed to be a mom again;  
I carry that lesson in each breath and each heartbeat,  
Knowing love waits at the far edge of every fear.

[Chorus-Outro — full arrangement, gentle fade]  
You opened your heart—and I found strength in the scar;  
The fear didn’t disappear, but it taught me how to heal;  
Now I walk forward, rooted in clarity and grace,  
You opened your heart—and I found strength in the scar.
