**[Verse 1]**

Peter Pan ride, cotton candy skies  
Infant ears stitched with “Aries Baby” pride  
Churros in hand, I whispered the news  
Flying over NeverLand, just me and you

**[Pre-Chorus]**

But the silence came too soon  
No heartbeat in the room  
I held my breath, I held my soul  
And watched the dream let go

**[Chorus]**

I lost you in the whirlwind  
While the world threw stones at me  
They said I lied, they said I faked  
While I was breaking silently  
But they can never take  
What God has for me  
No, they can never take  
What God has for me

---

**[Verse 2]**

Forty years and one surprise  
A love that bloomed beneath the RHOSLC lights  
Old friends gone, cast turned cold  
My mother’s voice, a story untold

**[Bridge]**

I was shredded by the comments  
While grieving what I’d never hold  
But faith became my blanket  
And silence made me whole

---

**[Chorus]**

I lost you in the whirlwind  
While the world threw stones at me  
They said I lied, they said I faked  
While I was breaking silently  
But they can never take  
What God has for me  
No, they can never take  
What God has for me

---

**[Outro]**

So I walk with grace, not shame  
In the quiet, I reclaim your name  
You were real, you were mine  
A heartbeat lost, but love divine
```
