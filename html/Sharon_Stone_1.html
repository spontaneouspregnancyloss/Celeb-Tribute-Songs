Song Description  
Lyrics built solely from Sharon Stone’s public first-person accounts of miscarriage (2019 Vogue, 2022 Instagram, 2023 Extra). Tone is compassionate, restrained, and candid—no speculation. Music styled to her affinity for Fleetwood Mac and “standards”: a piano-driven soft-rock ballad with intimate phrasing.

Lyrics

[Verse 1 female vocals, piano-led, light guitar]  
I tally the months I crossed and couldn’t stay,  
Five and a half, and the world kept turning,  
No room to put down the weight I was holding,  
No space to say what my body and heart already knew.

[Pre-Chorus softer vocal lift, brushed drums enter]  
They tell you to hush, to keep it tidy,  
As if grief is something private and neat.

[Chorus strong female vocal, fuller band with strings]  
Not a small thing—don’t make me carry it alone;  
Give me compassion, the empathy and the healing named out loud;  
I won’t wear shame for what I couldn’t control,  
I’m saying it plainly so I don’t bear it alone.

[Verse 2 vocals steady, piano forward]  
There were so many losses I stopped counting out loud,  
Nine times I learned how absence can ache in the body,  
How a room can go silent after hours of effort,  
How the drive home can be the darkest mile.

[Pre-Chorus gentle rise, harmony layers]  
I needed a mother’s arms around that emptiness,  
But the world had meetings, and lights, and go on.

[Chorus full dynamics, emotive strings swell]  
Not a small thing—don’t make me carry it alone;  
Give me compassion, the empathy and the healing named out loud;  
I won’t wear shame for what I couldn’t control,  
I’m saying it plainly so I don’t bear it alone.

[Bridge intimate vocal, piano and soft strings only]  
I learned to speak when there wasn’t a forum,  
To step out of secrecy, refuse that failure they assign;  
My voice is the space I wasn’t given,  
My truth is the hand I needed at the time.

[Chorus-Out soaring female vocal, full band then fade to piano]  
Not a small thing—stand with me, say it out loud,  
Compassion, empathy, healing—let them crowd out the doubt.  
I won’t wear shame; I’m laying it down,  
Not a small thing—and I’m not alone.
