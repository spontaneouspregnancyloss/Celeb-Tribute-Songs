**🎵 Song 2: _“Not Fine”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
I smiled for the camera,  
But my heart was torn.  
They asked how I was doing,  
I said, “I’m fine,” like I’d been sworn.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But inside I was breaking,  
A mother without her child.  
I wanted to scream the truth,  
But I just nodded and smiled.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not fine,  
Though I wear the mask.  
I’m not fine,  
Don’t even ask.  
I’m healing, yes,  
But slowly, painfully,  
I confess.

**[Verse 2]**  
I had an attachment,  
To someone I never met.  
I planned a life around you,  
Now I live with regret.

**[Bridge]**  
Later miscarriage,  
Still a birth.  
Still a name,  
Still a worth.

**[Outro]**  
I’m not fine,  
But I’m still here.  
I’m not fine,  
But I’m sincere.
