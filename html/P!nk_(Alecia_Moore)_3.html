**Version 1 – Rock Anthem Lane (_So What_, _Just Like a Pill_)**

Fast, punchy, shouted cadence. Rhyme snaps, crowd-shout chorus.

**[Verse 1]**  
Seventeen, I crashed down hard,  
Body broke the deal, left me scarred.  
Carried shame like lead in my veins,  
Every whisper screaming my name.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I’m not your victim, not your ghost,  
I turned my pain into the toast.

**[Chorus]**  
Broken? I’m unbroken! Louder, screw the pain!  
Shattered, scarred, outspoken, I rise again.  
Bruises, burns, they show it, I wear the flame—  
Broken? I’m unbroken, louder than the shame!

**[Verse 2]**  
Fell down twice, got cut again,  
Therapy dragged the lies to the pen.  
Saw the truth in a cracked-up glass,  
Screamed so hard till the hurt collapsed.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Scars are the proof that I survived,  
This broken body’s still alive.

**[Chorus]**  
Broken? I’m unbroken! Louder, screw the pain!  
Shattered, scarred, outspoken, I rise again.  
Bruises, burns, they show it, I wear the flame—  
Broken? I’m unbroken, louder than the shame!

**[Bridge]**  
I joke when I’m bleeding, laugh when I choke,  
I burn all the silence down into smoke.  
I’m not afraid of the fight in my skin,  
The body betrayed me, but I still win.

**[Final Chorus]**  
Broken? I’m unbroken! Louder, screw the pain!  
Shattered, scarred, outspoken, I rise again.  
Bruises, burns, they show it, I wear the flame—  
Broken? I’m unbroken, louder than the shame!

**[Outro – shouted]**  
Un-bro-ken! Un-bro-ken!  
Stronger than the shame!

**200-character style:**  
Explosive pop-rock anthem with distorted guitars, pounding drums, and shouted vocals. Tight rhymes, raw attitude, unfiltered defiance—fist-pumping hook that turns scars into power.

**300-character style:**  
High-energy rock anthem driven by distorted guitars, stomping drums, and ragged, shouted vocals. Defiant tone channels P!nk’s rebel hits (_So What_, _Just Like a Pill_). Tight rhyme punch, raw attitude, humor through pain. Chorus is a fist-pump chant; outro shouts “unbroken” like a battle cry.
