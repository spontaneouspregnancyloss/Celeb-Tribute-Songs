### Song Description

_The Losses We Share_ drifts through fleeting images: ordinary mornings interrupted by rupture, white hospital walls, the weight of a hand held in despair. The song eschews linear storytelling for imagistic fragments, allowing grief to surface as visual echoes. At its heart: the question “Are you OK?”—at once an intimate plea and a public call.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
Crayon underfoot,  
Archie’s hair warm against my chin.  
A sharp tear inside—  
Lullaby fractured mid-note.

**[Chorus]**  
Between cradle and silence,  
Grief writes itself on my skin.  
Almost unbearable—yet hidden,  
Are you OK? whispers begin.

**[Verse 2]**  
Hospital walls—white, unmoving.  
My husband’s hand, damp, trembling.  
Eyes glazed, searching for air.  
Two hearts in one silence.

**[Chorus]**  
Between cradle and silence,  
Grief writes itself on my skin.  
Almost unbearable—yet hidden,  
Are you OK? whispers begin.

**[Bridge]**  
In a room of a hundred—  
ten, twenty cradle the same ache.  
But voices hush,  
Taboo pressing like stone.

**[Final Chorus]**  
Between cradle and silence,  
Grief breathes, asking: Are you OK?  
When one voice dares truth,  
A hundred more find their way.

**[Outro]**  
A lullaby for two—  
One held, one gone.  
Still carried, still heard,  
In the quiet we share.
