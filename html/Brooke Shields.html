**\[Verse 1 -- soft piano intro, voice should sound weary but
composed\]**\
In my mid-thirties, I tried to heal,\
A biopsy carved what time would steal.\
Scarred and shortened, my body changed,\
But no one warned what that arranged.

**\[Verse 2 -- build with strings, voice should carry quiet
frustration\]**\
We tried through science, through hope and pain,\
A catheter blocked, they tried again.\
Through my belly, life was placed,\
And for a moment, joy embraced.

**\[Pre-Chorus -- gentle vocal rise, emphasize emotional tension\]**\
Three months in, the light grew dim,\
A silent shift, a violent hymn.\
I asked if scar tissue screamed,\
As my body tore through dreams.

**\[Chorus -- soaring melody, voice should sound raw but steady\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
A loss so aching,\
No room for desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.

**\[Verse 3 -- return to minimal instrumentation, voice should sound
introspective\]**\
No one said this could unfold,\
That healing could leave me cold.\
Had I known, I might have swayed,\
Made choices that better stayed.

**\[Pre-Chorus -- repeat with slight variation, add harmony\]**\
I asked if pain had memory,\
If stretching scars could set me free.\
But answers came too late,\
In the shadow of fate.

**\[Chorus -- repeat with layered vocals and strings\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
A loss so aching,\
No room for desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.

**\[Bridge -- spoken word option or whispered vocals\]**\
This was not a choice I made,\
But a truth I had to face.\
And in the silence of that night,\
I became someone else.

**\[Final Chorus -- stripped down, voice should sound resolved\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
But I rose from aching,\
With a quiet, fierce desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.

**Suno-Style Production Notes (Paragraph Form)**

This track is a cinematic pop ballad rooted in Brooke Shields&#39; true
miscarriage experience. The female vocal should be intimate, weary, and
emotionally raw, with moments of strength and reflection.
Instrumentation should begin with sparse piano and gradually build with
strings and ambient textures to reflect the physical and emotional
intensity of the twelve-hour ordeal. The hook is designed to be haunting
and memorable, capturing the trauma and transformation of spontaneous
pregnancy loss. Production should emphasize space, silence, and
emotional pacing, allowing the story to unfold with dignity and truth.

**Style Sheet (200 characters)**
