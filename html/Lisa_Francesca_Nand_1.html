Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
Twelve weeks in, then silence  
No warning, no goodbye  
I stared at the ceiling  
And let the moment pass me by

**Pre-Chorus**  
I went to work the next day  
Smiled like I was fine  
But half of me stayed behind  
In that sterile room and time

**Chorus**  
Split in two / no one could see  
The part of me / that ceased to be  
I didn’t know how to grieve  
So I pretended to believe

**Verse 2**  
Emails, meetings, coffee breaks  
I wore my face like armor  
Inside, I was unraveling  
But outside, I was a charmer

**Pre-Chorus**  
They asked about my weekend  
I said it was okay  
But I was still in pieces  
From the life that slipped away

**Chorus**  
Split in two / no one could see  
The part of me / that ceased to be  
I didn’t know how to grieve  
So I pretended to believe

**Bridge**  
It felt like I was split in two  
A body moving, a soul subdued  
No flowers, no cards, no name  
Just quiet loss and quiet shame

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unknown  
A story I call my own
