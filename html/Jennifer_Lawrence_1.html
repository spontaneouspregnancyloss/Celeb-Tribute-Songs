**🎵 Song 1: _“Montreal”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Intro]**  
I was alone in Montreal,  
No one knew, no one to call.

**[Verse 1]**  
I had a plan, I had a choice,  
But the silence came without a voice.  
I felt the shift, I knew the sign,  
A heartbeat lost before it was mine.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I thought I’d be ready,  
But grief doesn’t wait.  
It comes like a whisper,  
It opens the gate.

**[Chorus]**  
Montreal, I cried alone,  
In a room that wasn’t home.  
I held the ache, I held the fear,  
But no one saw the tears.

**[Verse 2]**  
Years later, on a film set,  
I felt the joy, I felt the threat.  
Another loss, another name,  
Another body not the same.

**[Bridge]**  
I’ve had a great pregnancy,  
But I remember the pain.  
Every second felt different,  
Every cloud carried rain.

**[Outro]**  
Montreal, you changed me,  
In ways no one could see.
