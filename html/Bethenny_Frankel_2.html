Lyrics
**Draft 1 --- Narrative arc (timeline)**
**Verse 1**\
I thought I had more time to see,\
Life was rushing ahead of me.\
At forty-one, I knew the cost,\
Joy and fear for what was lost.

**Pre-Chorus**\
It was brief, it slipped away,\
No choice in how the cards would play.

**Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Verse 2**\
Doctors' words were calm, direct,\
Life's a script you don't expect.\
I stood steady, though I bled,\
Grateful still for what I had.

**Pre-Chorus**\
It was brief, it slipped away,\
But I choose to live each day.

**Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.

**Bridge**\
I speak my truth, I own my part,\
No silence weighing on my heart.\
Sharing sorrow makes it real,\
But honesty's the way I heal.

**Final Chorus**\
Strong but shaken, that's who I am,\
Dreams don't follow a perfect plan.\
A chapter closed, yet love remains,\
Hope still flickers through the pain.
