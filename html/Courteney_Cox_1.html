**🎼 Song 1: “Seven Times” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “I had seven miscarriages.”

**[Verse 1]**  
I get pregnant easily,  
But keeping them was hard.  
Seven times I held a dream,  
Seven times it fell apart.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I kept trying,  
Even when it hurt.

**[Chorus]**  
Seven times I whispered hope,  
Seven times I broke.  
Still I stood, still I prayed,  
Still I found a way.

**[Verse 2]**  
IVF and quiet tears,  
A daughter born through pain.

**[Bridge]**  
I don’t forget the ones I lost,  
They live in me.

**[Outro]**  
Seven times,  
Still I believe.
