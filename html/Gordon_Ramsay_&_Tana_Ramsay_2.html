**🎼 Song 2: “Leaving Empty” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “You’re leaving the hospital and you haven’t got a baby.”

**[Verse 1]**  
White walls, quiet halls,  
A name we couldn’t call.  
We walked out with nothing,  
But memories of it all.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Strong heartbeat,  
But too small.

**[Chorus]**  
Leaving empty,  
But full of love.  
Leaving broken,  
But rising above.

**[Verse 2]**  
Rocky lived in seconds,  
But stays in years.

**[Bridge]**  
We carry him in silence,  
And in our tears.

**[Outro]**  
Leaving empty,  
But never alone.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Leaving empty / But full of love”_
