### Style Descriptions

**200 Character Style**  
A stripped-down piano ballad, tender yet powerful, carrying Mariah’s trademark vocal crescendos, shaped from her own words about silence, grief, and the dark isolation of miscarriage.

**300 Character Style**  
This poignant ballad draws directly from Mariah Carey’s first-hand account of her 2008 miscarriage. Built on minimal piano and strings, it rises into soaring, emotive choruses that echo her struggle with silence, darkness, and the unspoken weight of loss, channeling her signature R&B-pop ballad style.

### Song Description

“Silent Darkness” narrates Mariah Carey’s deeply personal account of miscarriage. Using only her first-person reflections, the song follows her emotional journey from the shock of loss, into the isolating silence where she felt unable to speak, and then to her later reflection on being pressured before she was ready to share. The song’s structure mirrors her testimony: verse lines recount the timeline, while the chorus carries the core truth of silent pain and unspoken grief.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
It happened so quietly, no warning came,  
The joy disappeared, replaced with pain.  
It shook us both, we fell into the dark,  
A shadowed silence where I lost my spark.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t find a way,  
To tell the world what was taken that day.

**[Chorus]**  
I carried the silence, I carried the pain,  
In shadows alone, with no words to explain.  
The weight of the moment, the loss I concealed,  
A wound in my soul that may never be healed.

**[Verse 2]**  
They asked me to smile, to pour out the truth,  
But my heart wasn’t ready, it was far too soon.  
The spotlight was cruel, the questions unkind,  
I held back my story, I guarded my mind.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I wasn’t prepared, my voice wasn’t free,  
The silence itself was protecting me.

**[Chorus]**  
I carried the silence, I carried the pain,  
In shadows alone, with no words to explain.  
The weight of the moment, the loss I concealed,  
A wound in my soul that may never be healed.

**[Bridge]**  
Darkness surrounded, I walked it alone,  
With nothing to say, and no place called home.  
But time gave me courage, to whisper at last,  
Of the grief in my heart, of the love in my past.

**[Chorus - Reprise]**  
I carried the silence, I carried the pain,  
In shadows alone, with no words to explain.  
The silence was heavy, the silence was real,  
But breaking it now helps the memory heal.

**[Outro]**  
Still carried within me, the loss and the love,  
A silence once breaking, now spoken above.
