```lyrics
**[Verse 1]**

I was moving, always giving,  
Never paused to feel I‚Äôm living.  
Pouring out for everyone,  
But forgot to face the sun.

Then the silence broke my stride,  
A little heartbeat said goodbye.  
And in that stillness, I could see,  
God was whispering to me.

---

**[Pre-Chorus]**

I‚Äôve been strong for oh so long,  
But even strength can get it wrong.  
Now I‚Äôm learning how to grieve,  
And still believe‚Ä¶ and still believe.

---

**[Hook ‚Äì Rhythmic & Everlasting]**

**Still learning to breathe, still learning to cry,**  
**Still Carried hope when I don‚Äôt know why.**  
**Still finding the light in the hardest place,**  
**Still dancing in faith, still covered in grace.**  
**Still learning to breathe‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs okay.**  
_(Repeat with choir harmonies swelling)_

---

**[Verse 2]**

I never knew this kind of pain,  
But I won‚Äôt let it be in vain.  
I see the lesson in the loss,  
The crown behind the heavy cross.

I‚Äôm not broken, just undone,  
Still a mother, still someone.  
And though I haven‚Äôt healed it all,  
I rise again when I fall.

**[Bridge ‚Äì Spoken Word with Choir Underscore]**

_"I‚Äôve always tried to find the good, Even when I didn‚Äôt feel understood. This loss taught me to slow down, To feel, to rest, to wear my crown."_

---

**[Final Hook ‚Äì Modulated & Soaring]**

**Still learning to breathe, still learning to cry,**  
**Still Carried hope when I don‚Äôt know why.**  
**Still finding the light in the hardest place,**  
**Still dancing in faith, still covered in grace.**  
**Still learning to breathe‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs okay.**  
**Yes, I‚Äôm learning to breathe‚Ä¶ more every day.**
```
