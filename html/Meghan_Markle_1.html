### Song Description

_Lullaby for Two, One Lost_ follows Meghan’s own articulated experience: a normal July morning tilting into sudden loss; the visceral moment of clutching her child and realizing another was lost; the hospital’s grief and desperation to heal; culminating in her call to the collective—“Are you OK?”—as a tool of solace and shared humanity.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
Breakfast routines, a crayon underfoot,  
Ponytail tossed, and Archie in my arms.  
A sharp cramp struck—a lullaby for the unsure,  
A hush descended—I felt the loss before the alarms.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I knew, as I held my firstborn close,  
I was losing my second, silent under my ribs.

**[Chorus]**  
I carry an almost unbearable grief,  
A quiet burden—shared but seldom spoken.  
In that hospital’s white glow, facing grief so brief,  
I thought: “Are you OK?” helps when hearts are broken.

**[Verse 2]**  
Clutching my husband’s clammy hand,  
We gazed at cold white walls in despair.  
Eyes glazed over, we tried to understand,  
How two hearts, shattered, could begin to repair.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Losing a child means this silent ache;  
It’s common, yet taboo—so many hearts that break.

**[Chorus]**  
I carry an almost unbearable grief,  
A quiet burden—shared but seldom spoken.  
With every whispered, "Are you OK?" belief  
May bloom again where hope was broken.

**[Bridge]**  
In rooms of women, ten or twenty know this ache—  
Yet shame keeps voices sealed, grief a lonely wake.  
When one speaks truth, others find permission,  
To carry less lone sorrow, to reach toward healing.

**[Final Chorus]**  
I carry an almost unbearable grief,  
A quiet burden—shared but seldom spoken.  
So let me ask you now, in this moment brief—  
Are you OK? Together, let grief be broken.

**[Outro]**  
A lullaby for two, one gone, one held dear—  
In shared hush, we learn to heal, we learn to hear.
