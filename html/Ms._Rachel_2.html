Song Description  
This song expands on Ms. Rachel’s expression of love to “anyone who understands” miscarriage.  
By framing _yesterday_ with detached medical language (“product of conception”) and contrasting it with _today and forever_ (where memory and love are still carried), it honors both the reality of loss and the enduring bond beyond it. The repeated _we_ voice makes the piece communal: the singer and listener stand together, carrying memory forward.

Lyrics

[Intro — soft piano arpeggio, single FEMALE ONLY! voice]  
Yesterday was papers, words too cold, too plain,  
A label written down that could not hold your name.  
The silence pressed against our chest,  
A heavy room, an empty nest.

[Pre-Chorus — piano with faint strings MIXED VOCALS]  
And though the world moved on outside,  
Inside our hearts, a flame survived.  
We learned the meaning deep and strong:

[Chorus — layered harmonies, gentle percussion enters, MIXED VOCALS]  
Yesterday was silence, but today we speak your name.  
Tomorrow and forever, the memory remains.  
Motionless or moving on,  
We are still carried, together we belong.

[Verse 2 — softer, reflective piano, FEMALE VOCALS]  
Today we sing, though the ache is near,  
A rainbow rising makes the colors clear.  
And love for what was lost remains,  
A river flowing through our pain.

[Pre-Chorus — swelling strings, harmonies rising, MIXED VOCALS]  
We hear the hearts who know this too,  
We send the love that guides us through.  
Together, together — me and you:

[Chorus — fuller harmonies, light drum pulse, MIXED VOCALS]  
Yesterday was silence, but today we speak your name.  
Tomorrow and forever, the memory remains.  
Motionless or moving on,  
We are still carried, together we belong.

[Bridge — whisper vocal, minimal piano, FEMALE VOCALS]  
A candle that still burns,  
A dawn that still returns.  
A heartbeat through the years,  
Still carried, still here.

[Final Chorus — return to full instrumentation, soaring harmonies, MIXED VOCALS]  
Yesterday was silence, but today we speak your name.  
Tomorrow and forever, the memory remains.  
Motionless or moving on,  
We are still carried, together we belong.

[Outro — piano only, fading, FEMALE ONLY]  
Still carried… still carried… still carried home.
