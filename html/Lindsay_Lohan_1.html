Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
I disappeared for two weeks  
No headlines, no calls  
Just a body breaking quietly  
Behind hotel walls

**Pre-Chorus**  
I was sick, not just tired  
Something deeper, something wired  
A silence I couldn’t explain  
A loss I couldn’t name

**Chorus**  
Two weeks gone / and no one knew  
But I did / I always do  
It’s a very long story  
That I carry through

**Verse 2**  
They filmed the rest without me  
I watched from behind the screen  
Pretending I was healing  
While unraveling unseen

**Pre-Chorus**  
No one asked, and I didn’t tell  
It’s easier to wear the shell  
But inside, I felt the shift  
A life that never got to live

**Chorus**  
Two weeks gone / and no one knew  
But I did / I always do  
It’s a very long story  
That I carry through

**Bridge**  
I said it once, just once aloud  
No one knows this, not allowed  
But it happened, and it stays  
In quiet nights and sideways days

**Outro**  
Two weeks gone / still in my skin  
A secret loss / I hold within
