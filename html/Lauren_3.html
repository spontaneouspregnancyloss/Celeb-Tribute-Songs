Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
I was ready, heart wide open  
Held the hope in every breath  
Dreamt of lullabies and morning light  
A name already whispered in my chest

**Pre-Chorus**  
The room was quiet, then it changed  
A shift too fast to understand  
I gave my all, I gave my love  
And left before I held his hand

**Chorus**  
I was the love / I was the light  
I was the mother / Just for one night  
He carries me / In every cry  
In every heartbeat, I survive

**Verse 2**  
He said I smiled through every storm  
That I could comfort with a glance  
I was the kind who made you feel  
Like you belonged, like you could dance

**Pre-Chorus**  
They speak my name with reverence now  
A warmth that lingers in the air  
I didnâ€™t stay, but I remain  
In every touch, in every prayer

**Chorus**  
I was the love / I was the light  
I was the mother / Just for one night  
He carries me / In every cry  
In every heartbeat, I survive

**Bridge**  
Of all the things I ever was  
Being a mother was the most  
Though time was brief, the bond was deep  
And love outlives the final ghost

**Outro**  
So sing me soft into the dawn  
Where memory and grace belong  
I was the love, I was the light  
Still carried on, still carried on
