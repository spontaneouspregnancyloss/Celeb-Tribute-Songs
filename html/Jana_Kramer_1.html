**🎵 Song 1: _“Broken Again”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
I bled so bad, I thought it was the end,  
I told you I couldn’t do this again.  
I’ve had a bunch, each one a scar,  
Each one a wish that didn’t get far.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I feel broken, I feel worn,  
But I still wake up each morn.

**[Chorus]**  
Broken again, still trying,  
Broken again, still crying.  
But I’m not done, I’m still here,  
Even when the path’s unclear.

**[Verse 2]**  
I don’t know if I can carry more,  
But I’ve said that before.

**[Bridge]**  
Even when I doubt, I grieve,  
Even when I fall, I believe.

**[Outro]**  
Broken again, still me,  
Broken again, still free.
