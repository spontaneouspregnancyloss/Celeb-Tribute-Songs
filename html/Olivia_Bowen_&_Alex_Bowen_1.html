**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
A soft acoustic ballad, in first-person voice: gentle phrasing, slant rhymes, grounded tone. Built from Olivia's own resonant words: “bittersweet,” “completely floored,” “excruciating pain,” “you existed”—without embellishment.

**300 Character Style**  
A minimalist, introspective folk-pop piece—spare guitar, light piano, and a heartbeat rhythm—voiced in Olivia Bowen’s own experience: the shock of vanishing twin, the bittersweet grief, the hold of memory. Maintains respect, clarity, and grounded simplicity.

**Song Description**  
Inspired only by Olivia Bowen’s direct, first-person public quotes about losing a twin at eight weeks from _Loose Women_, _Fabulous_/_The Sun_, and _People_, this song captures the emotional complexity she described: shock, grief entwined with gratitude, the memory of the lost baby, and the healing power of sharing. The tone remains trauma-informed, respectful, and non-speculative.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1]  
We stared at the screen and saw two little lives,  
then one faded, no warning, no sign.  
Completely floored—no light, no pain, just gone,  
I sat numb, breath caught in disbelief.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Bittersweet tug of hope and grief,  
my heart split in a silent echo.

[Chorus / Hook]  
I carry two hearts—one beating, one whispered, both always ours.  
You existed, you were loved, forever part of our story.  
I carry two hearts—one living, one fading, both held close to mine.

[Verse 2]  
No symptoms, no bleeding, no clue—just vanished,  
a twin absorbed back into me, cells becoming part of who I am.  
Excruciating pain amid joy for the one still growing,  
two lives entwined in grief and love.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Bittersweet tug of hope and grief,  
my heart split in a silent echo.

[Bridge]  
It was therapy saying it out loud—connection, not isolation.  
You are forever part of us, and sharing made us less alone.

[Outro]  
Some things are too fragile to speak but too real to ignore—  
I carry two hearts, one seen, one remembered.  
Both are ours, both are home.
