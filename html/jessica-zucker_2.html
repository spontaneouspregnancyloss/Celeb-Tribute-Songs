**🎵 Song 2: _“Cruel Joke”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
The room was ready,  
My heart was too.  
But fate played tricks,  
And I withdrew.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It felt like a cruel joke,  
A twist I couldn’t see.  
I was pregnant,  
But not really.

**[Chorus]**  
Cruel joke, still real,  
Cruel joke, still feel.  
I held the ache, I held the name,  
Even though it never came.

**[Verse 2]**  
No baby to feed,  
But milk arrived.  
A mother’s body,  
Still deprived.

**[Bridge]**  
I speak the pain so others heal,  
I show the world what’s raw and real.

**[Outro]**  
Cruel joke, still alive,  
Cruel joke, still I strive.
