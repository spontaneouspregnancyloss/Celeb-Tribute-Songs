200 Character Style  
Quiet indie-folk: warm acoustic guitar, soft piano, light electronics under the skin. Vocal is direct, conversational — the arrangement echoes Mark’s candid post and the tech-leaning, eclectic references in his music taste.

300 Character Style  
A rounded, reflective indie-folk ballad with subtle electronic pads: front-and-center voice, fingerpicked guitar, minimal beats, and ambient synths providing emotional color. The writing uses plainspoken, confessional phrasing to mirror Mark’s public Facebook post about miscarriage and the aim to open a conversation.

Song Description  
This song is built from Mark Zuckerberg’s first-person public post and follow-up interviews in which he described miscarriages as “a lonely experience,” explained that they had endured multiple losses, and said they shared their story to encourage open dialogue. The voice here is first-person and reflective — not performative — and the music mixes acoustic and subtle electronic elements to echo his public persona and eclectic tastes (Green Day/Nirvana/Daft Punk/Lady Gaga have all been mentioned as part of his listening history).

Lyrics — **Draft 1 (Narrative / Confessional)**  
[Verse 1 — male vocal, fingerpicked guitar, warm piano under]  
We learned to picture futures in a single breath,  
Names, rooms, the little things you plan before the dawn.  
Then plans would fold and leave a quiet where a voice had been,  
You start imagining them — and then they’re gone.

[Pre-Chorus — soft synth pad, vocal close]  
It’s a lonely experience — I said that because it was,  
Quiet, hollow, like a hallway with no one calling out.

[Chorus / Hook — gentle build, harmonies, subtle percussion]  
[Chorus] I’ll say it out loud so someone hears what’s been silent,  
[Chorus] We had losses that taught us the weight of hope,  
[Chorus] We shared so another voice won’t feel alone,  
[Chorus] I’ll say it out loud so someone hears what’s been silent.

[Verse 2 — steady rhythm, piano motif returns]  
We’d watch a tiny thumb on a screen and smile,  
Simple proof of life — a little gesture that meant a lot,  
Then there were the empty mornings and the quiet questions,  
And you learn how grief can sound inside a home.

[Bridge — stripped back to guitar + soft electronics]  
I don’t pretend to know all the answers, only this:  
Speaking gives a map for people moving through the dark,  
If my words make a doorway where none were before,  
Then the lonely can find a room to rest.

[Chorus-Out — harmonies widen, then fade to single guitar]  
[Chorus] I’ll say it out loud so someone hears what’s been silent,  
[Chorus] We had losses that taught us the weight of hope,  
[Chorus] We shared so another voice won’t feel alone,  
[Chorus] I’ll say it out loud — you are not alone.
