Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Piano and warm strings support a close vocal with tighter end-rhymes and gentle internal echoes; restrained dynamics keep the spotlight on truth, not drama.

300 Character Style  
A classical-pop ballad with refined rhyme craft: ABAB/AABB patterns in verses, a symmetrical, memorable hook, and soft internal rhymes. Sparse arrangement—piano, light strings—lets a steady vocal deliver grounded, compassionate lines.

Song Description  
A first-person, trauma-informed lyric built only from Myleene Klass’s public accounts: the scan while abroad, miscarrying while live on air, a “missed miscarriage” where the body carried on, clinical D&C paperwork, and her resolve to speak so others feel less alone. This revision deepens rhyme cohesion (clear end-rhymes and mild internal chime) while keeping language simple, faithful, and non-speculative.

Lyrics  
[Verse 1]  
I learned the language of light on a screen,  
a room too bright, the picture still serene.  
A holiday turned hallway—hope withdrew;  
we walked out holding silence we both knew.

[Pre-Chorus]  
This ache keeps breathing under bone;  
it follows daylight, stays my own.  
When I speak up, the weight refrains;  
when I keep quiet, sorrow reigns.

[Chorus]  
Still, I carry what I can’t hold tight,  
I won’t conceal it—I’ll stand in light.  
I name a love that never grows old;  
I keep it open—let truth be told.  
If this can steady one wandering soul,  
I’ll keep on speaking, to console.

[Verse 2]  
Under the red light, the countdown ran;  
I filled the links, I followed the plan.  
I felt a thunder, quiet and low,  
but kept my voice till the end of the show.  
Some losses slip between headline lines;  
you hold the mic as the heart resigns.

[Pre-Chorus]  
My body carried on though the beat had gone,  
a silent mismatch I could not lean on.  
I named it betrayal, under my breath,  
learning to trust what was left of flesh.

[Bridge]  
Paper and tick-box, clinical codes;  
shaking hands signing unsayable loads.  
Where joy and sorrow cross and entwine,  
I learned how little the words align.

[Outro]  
I keep a lamp in the window’s glow  
for anyone wandering, moving slow.  
If one lost soul can find the road,  
I’ll keep on speaking, sharing the load.
