**🎵 Song 1: _“Three Months”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Three months of dreaming, three months of light,  
I held the hope close every night.  
But silence grew where heartbeat should be,  
And truth came slow, unraveling me.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
They said it was a blighted ovum,  
Words I’d never heard before.  
I’d been pregnant, but not really,  
Still I mourned what I adored.

**[Chorus]**  
Three months, no lullaby,  
Three months, no reason why.  
I carried love, I carried grace,  
Even in that empty space.

**[Verse 2]**  
It dragged on like a winter storm,  
No clear end, no final form.  
I waited for the ache to pass,  
But grief can linger, slow and vast.

**[Bridge]**  
Even though you weren’t really there,  
I felt you in the quiet air.  
A name I never got to say,  
Still echoes in me every day.

**[Outro]**  
Three months, still I cry,  
Three months, no goodbye.
