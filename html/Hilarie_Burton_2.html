**🎵 Song 2: _“Science Experiment”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Needles on the counter,  
Hope in sterile jars.  
I wasn’t chasing magic,  
I was chasing stars.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The romance disappeared,  
Replaced by charts and scans.  
I felt like a stranger,  
In my own hands.

**[Chorus]**  
Science experiment,  
No soft embrace.  
Science experiment,  
Just a clinical race.  
But I kept going,  
Kept the faith.

**[Verse 2]**  
My body betrayed me,  
But I still tried.  
I wore my grief like makeup,  
And smiled while I cried.

**[Bridge]**  
We found our rhythm in the wreckage,  
We found our voice in the void.

**[Outro]**  
Science experiment,  
Still alive.  
Science experiment,  
Still I strive.
