## **Song  2 — “Shadows of a Spark”**

[Verse 1 — female vocals, sparse guitar arpeggio + faint vinyl crackle]  
Glass vials lined like tiny stars on the table,  
Needles glint in lamplight, prayers under breath,  
I held a spark—brief, impossible, fragile,  
Then silence fell heavy as a closed door.

[Pre-Chorus — piano enters, breathy layered harmonies]  
A flicker lit the room, then faded in my hands,  
Still the echo whispered: you are more than this.

[Chorus / Hook — warm synth pad, gentle drum pulse, soaring vocal lift]  
[Hook] Just the thought was magical, even for a while,  
[Hook] Heartbreak took the moment, but hope stayed alive,  
Through the ache, through the quiet, I still hear you say,  
“Love is stronger, it will find its way.”

[Verse 2 — muted guitar strums, background hum like heartbeat]  
Sterile rooms, white walls, long corridors,  
Hormones tracing storms inside my veins,  
But your voice carried me—steady, unshaken,  
A lighthouse in the fog, a promise I could lean on.

[Bridge — stripped down, single piano with reverb, hushed vocal delivery]  
Grief pressed against my chest like nightfall,  
Yet in the dark I saw a lantern glow—  
Your hands around mine, your light around me,  
Even loss could not take that away.

[Chorus / Hook — full arrangement returns, layered backing vocals]  
[Hook] Just the thought was magical, even for a while,  
[Hook] Heartbreak took the moment, but hope stayed alive,  
Through the ache, through the quiet, I still hear you say,  
“Love is stronger, it will find its way.”

[Outro — instruments thin out, female vocals soft + intimate]  
In the hush of night, I keep that spark,  
Shadows can’t erase what lit my heart,  
It was magical … even for a while.

This one leans more impressionistic — less narrative, more imagery (stars, vials, lighthouses, shadows) to embody her emotional arc.
