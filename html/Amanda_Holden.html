**Amanda Holden_Lyrics to Song**

**Title:** *Always His Mummy
Lyrics*

**Verse 1 (gentle, cinematic intro --- piano & strings)**

The screen went quiet, the air turned thin,\
A whisper of silence, a storm within.\
I sat in stillness, nothing left to say,\
Time stood frozen, love would find its way.

**Pre-Chorus (rising strings, tender build)**

For a moment I forgot what would come next,\
That I would still hold you, close to my chest.

**Chorus (emotive, open melody --- sweeping strings, theatre ballad)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Verse 2 (low strings, steady warmth)**

They carried me through those endless days,\
Kind hands that lifted, gentle grace.\
They showed us love when words had failed,\
Taught me that love remains, though fragile, frail.

**Pre-Chorus (slight swell)**

Though the house felt different, I could hear---\
Your place among us, always near.

**Chorus (stronger, soaring high notes)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Bridge (intimate, hushed --- candlelight imagery)**

On birthdays I light a flame for you,\
A quiet reminder, my love is true.\
Each year I whisper, and I let it show,\
In gratitude for the ones who helped me grow.

**Chorus (final, cinematic swell)**

I met you gently, then I said goodbye,\
You looked so peaceful, under heaven's sky.\
I was still your mummy, always, always will---\
You're part of us, forever, even still.

**Outro (soft piano, fading strings, almost spoken)**

I carry you forward, wherever I go...\
A little boy, my family, you'll always know.
