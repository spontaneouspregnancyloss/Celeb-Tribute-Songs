## Song Description

“The Box in My Drawer” is Lauren’s first SPL-themed track, inspired by her experience of a missed miscarriage. The song centers around the physical and emotional tokens she kept—positive pregnancy tests, scan photos, hospital leaflets, and even a parking ticket. These items become lyrical anchors in a song that explores the surreal nature of loss that the body doesn’t immediately recognize. With delicate piano and ambient textures, the track unfolds like a memory box, each verse revealing another layer of grief, confusion, and quiet strength. It’s a song for those who carry their loss in silence, and for the small tokens that hold a lifetime of love.

## Lyrics

```
[Intro]  
There’s a box in my drawer,  
Where the baby still lives.  
Two tests, a scan,  
And the love I still give.

[Verse 1]  
We found out in November,  
Shared the news with cheer.  
Joked about September,  
And the school year near.  
But light turned into shadow,  
At week number ten.  
The scan said six weeks,  
And silence began.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I left the hospital in shock,  
Didn’t cry, didn’t speak.  
The truth took weeks to settle,  
And grief began to leak.

[Chorus]  
There’s a box in my drawer,  
With a life that never grew.  
Cards from friends,  
And a parking ticket too.  
It might seem morbid,  
But it’s all I knew.  
There’s a box in my drawer,  
Where I still carry you.

[Verse 2]  
Five days later, bleeding came,  
A flood I couldn’t stop.  
Cervical shock took me down,  
My pressure dropped.  
I lost consciousness,  
They kept me overnight.  
No transfusion,  
But I lost my light.

[Bridge]  
I couldn’t care for my daughter,  
I couldn’t stand or speak.  
Signed off work for a month,  
Iron low, body weak.  
The trauma delayed the healing,  
The grief came in waves.  
Numbness, sadness, anger,  
In unpredictable days.

[Chorus]  
There’s a box in my drawer,  
With a life that never grew.  
Cards from friends,  
And a parking ticket too.  
It might seem morbid,  
But it’s all I knew.  
There’s a box in my drawer,  
Where I still carry you.

[Outro]  
I open it sometimes,  
When the silence is loud.  
I hold the memory gently,  
And I say your name out proud.
```
