Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Restrained, intimate ballad with light/slant rhymes, gentle acoustic pulse, and a compassionate, matter-of-fact delivery focused on lived experience—no embellishment, no speculation.

300 Character Style  
A quiet, reflective folk-pop ballad rooted in first-person honesty: soft guitar, spare piano, and a steady heartbeat rhythm. Language stays simple and grounded, echoing her words about “yearning,” grief, and the relief that follows—without dramatics or invented scenes.

Song Description  
Built strictly from Nicole Kidman’s own public, first-person accounts: she spoke of an ectopic pregnancy at the beginning of her marriage and a miscarriage at the end, calling the silence around miscarriage “massive grief,” and describing both the aching “yearning” and the eventual “Ahhhh” of joy after. Sources: _Tatler_ interview with direct quotes (June 2018) and syndications; Marie Claire 2007 interview clarifying ectopic pregnancy and later miscarriage.

Genre note (for arrangement feel): she’s publicly referenced loving Australian rock (AC/DC, INXS) and also lives in Nashville with country influences; we lean acoustic/folk-pop to keep the tone gentle and respectful.

Lyrics  
[Verse 1]  
From the start, I wanted a child—  
and then the start unraveled.  
They named it, and I learned the word,  
but mostly I learned the silence.  
I carried a question home,  
and it settled into my ribcage.  
No scenes to show, just a pause  
that lasted longer than talk.

[Pre-Chorus]  
There was an ache that would not quiet,  
a wanting that filled its own room.

[Chorus]  
Say it out loud—the loss we hush;  
I carried the yearning, I carried the hush.  
If no one speaks, the grief gets heavier;  
I won’t pretend it weighed me less.  
Say it out loud—the loss we hush;  
I carried the yearning, I carried the hush.

[Verse 2]  
At the end, another goodbye,  
different month, same language of empty.  
People keep walking around you,  
noticing the weather, not the weight.  
We chose our way forward then,  
love finding other doors to enter.  
I learned the shape of waiting,  
and how to hold what isn’t there.

[Pre-Chorus]  
There was an ache that would not quiet,  
a wanting that filled its own room.

[Chorus]  
Say it out loud—the loss we hush;  
I carried the yearning, I carried the hush.  
If no one speaks, the grief gets heavier;  
I won’t pretend it weighed me less.  
Say it out loud—the loss we hush;  
I carried the yearning, I carried the hush.

[Bridge]  
They say there’s joy on the other side;  
I felt the breath return—  
not forgetting, never erasing,  
just a softer edge to the ache.

[Outro]  
So I keep a light in the quiet,  
a place for the ones we don’t see.  
If you know the yearning, I hear you.  
If you know the loss—speak with me.
