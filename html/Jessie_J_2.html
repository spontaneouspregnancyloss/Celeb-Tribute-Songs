**üéµ Song 2: _‚ÄúNo One to Turn To‚Äù_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
I walked out of the scan,  
No words, no plan.  
I fell to my knees,  
Alone in the breeze.

**[Chorus]**  
No one to turn to,  
No one to see.  
I held the grief,  
Inside of me.

**[Verse 2]**  
I sang that night,  
With a towel between my legs.  
I smiled for the crowd,  
But I was on the edge.

**[Bridge]**  
I shared the news,  
So no one feels alone.  
I gave my pain a name,  
A place to call home.

**[Outro]**  
No one to turn to,  
But I turned to me.
