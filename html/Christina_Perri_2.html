## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
November light, soft and gray,  
You slipped away that day.  
I held your name in silence,  
And let the world fade away.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Grief and joy,  
Dancing in the same room.

**[Chorus]**  
November light, bittersweet,  
You were gone, but complete.  
I learned to live,  
With love and grief.

**[Verse 2]**  
I promise you can too,  
Even when it feels untrue.

**[Bridge]**  
I’m here, I’m whole,  
Because of you.

**[Outro]**  
November light,  
Still shining through.
```
