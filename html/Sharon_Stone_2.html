Song Description  
Built solely from Sharon Stone’s first-person accounts of pregnancy loss. This draft uses imagery (dark roads, silent rooms, clocks, drives home) to express her experience without speculation. Tone is restrained, poetic, and compassionate, following her affinity for Fleetwood Mac and classic standard-style ballads.

Lyrics

[Verse 1 female vocals, piano-only intro]  
Fluorescent hours blur into a wordless room,  
Thirty-six slow clocks and then a still hush,  
Hands empty, body aching like a struck bell,  
The hallway swallows footsteps that won’t come back.

[Pre-Chorus soft lift, light brushed drums]  
I’m told to carry it quietly, like paperwork,  
To file it where no one has to see.

[Chorus fuller female vocal, piano + strings swell]  
Not a small thing—don’t make me carry it alone;  
Say the words: compassion, empathy, healing,  
Set them like candles on this dark road;  
I won’t accept shame as a souvenir.

[Verse 2 voice steady, guitar joins softly]  
Five and a half months can hold a lifetime,  
And still be measured as a secret I shouldn’t name;  
Nine times taught me how silence can echo in the body,  
How even the drive home can dim the sun.

[Bridge intimate vocal, piano with light strings]  
No room at work to set down the flowers,  
No notice for grief, no place to sit;  
So I speak where there wasn’t a forum,  
And make a little space with my breath.

[Chorus-Out soaring female vocal, full band with strings then fade to piano]  
Not a small thing—don’t make me carry it alone;  
Compassion, empathy, healing—let them be the hold,  
I’m done with the secrecy they taught me to keep,  
I’m done with the shame I don’t owe.
