**🎼 Song 2: “Broken Cyclist” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “I felt broken.”

**[Verse 1]**  
I rode through every finish line,  
But this one broke me down.  
No podium, no victory,  
Just silence all around.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I didn’t feel strong,  
I didn’t feel brave.

**[Chorus]**  
Broken cyclist, aching heart,  
Trying to restart.  
Broken cyclist, empty arms,  
Still chasing stars.

**[Verse 2]**  
I didn’t want the gold,  
Just a cradle to hold.

**[Bridge]**  
It’s the loneliest race,  
But I’m still in it.

**[Outro]**  
Broken cyclist,  
Still spinning.
