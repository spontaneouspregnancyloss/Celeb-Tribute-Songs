**🎵 Song 1: _“Grieving Quietly”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
We dreamed of lullabies,  
Of tiny shoes and morning cries.  
But grief came softly,  
With no sound, no goodbyes.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
IVF and silent tears,  
A love that disappeared.  
We held each other through the night,  
Grief wrapped tight in morning light.

**[Chorus]**  
Grieving quietly,  
Behind the scenes.  
Grieving quietly,  
In broken dreams.  
We don’t speak it loud,  
But it’s always there,  
In every breath, in every prayer.

**[Verse 2]**  
Deb had miscarriages,  
We held the pain.  
It’s rarely talked about,  
But it remains.

**[Bridge]**  
There’s a grieving you go through,  
A mourning that’s unseen.  
But love still finds a way,  
To live between.

**[Outro]**  
Grieving quietly,  
Still we sing.  
Grieving quietly,  
Still we cling.
