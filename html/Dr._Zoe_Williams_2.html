**🎼 Song 2: “No One Knows” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “No one knows.”

**[Verse 1]**  
She’s at her desk,  
Smiling through the pain.  
No one knows,  
She’s grieving again.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
We walk among the hurting,  
And never see the signs.

**[Chorus]**  
No one knows,  
But we’re not alone.  
No one sees,  
But we still breathe.

**[Verse 2]**  
I spoke to heal,  
And found my voice.

**[Bridge]**  
You will know someone,  
Who’s made that choice.

**[Outro]**  
No one knows,  
But talking helps us grow.
