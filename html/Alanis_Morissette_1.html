Song Draft 2 --- "Little Light"**

*(vignette/imagistic approach, styled for Alanis Morissette)*

Lyrics

**Verse 1**\
A calendar dotted with starts that didn't hold,\
Files on the table, papers soft from being told,\
Grief with fear, a tandem I learned to wear,\
Wanting three, wondering if I'd ever get there.

**Pre-Chorus**\
I kept moving --- prayer in one hand, steps in the other,\
Showing up anyway, one day after another.

**Chorus**\
Through surprises, devastations, I watched a small light,\
Flicker in downpour, stubborn and slight,\
An optimist who cries, but I don't let go,\
That little ember keeps saying: try once more.

**Verse 2**\
Investigation with tentacles, reaching through the dark,\
Rabbit holes for answers, every lead, every mark,\
Doctors smile at the thickness I bring,\
From home remedies to scripts --- everything.

**Bridge**\
Not the ideal story, one loss turned molar,\
The room grew quiet; the hallway felt colder,\
Still, trust kept working --- a pilot low-glow,\
I breathed with it gently, and let it slow.

**Outro**\
If the sky breaks open, I'll stand in that rain,\
Chasing, praying, showing up again,\
Loss taught me the rhythm; I hum it with care,\
A small, steady signal, I keep it there.
