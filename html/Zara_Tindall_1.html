Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Intimate acoustic ballad: soft vocal, fingerpicked guitar, light piano swells. Spacious phrasing, gentle rise into a memorable hook; no melodrama—steady warmth and restraint, grounded in first-person reflection.

300 Character Style  
Close-mic’d voice over fingerstyle guitar and subtle piano, brushed percussion entering only at the second chorus. Melody favors natural speech contours with slant rhyme. Emphasis on empathy, privacy vs. publicity, and time’s quiet healing; chorus lifts without bombast.

Song Description  
A restrained, first-person ballad built solely from Zara Tindall’s public words about miscarriage: the shock of “everyone knew,” the initial silence because it was “too raw,” the partner’s “helpless” grief, letters from others, a late loss requiring delivery, a later early loss, and the belief that “time’s a great healer.” The song traces that path toward a “stronger family” without invention or sensationalism.

Lyrics  
Verse 1  
When the news broke, it felt like the world did too—  
Hardest part was simple: everyone knew.  
Letters came in, pages of me-and-you,  
Saying, “we’ve been there,” and I read them through.

Pre-Chorus  
I kept my voice low, the days were too raw,  
Holding the silence like breath in my jaw.

Chorus  
I’m not the only one aching in this room—  
He’s standing beside me, lost a child too.  
I carry the quiet; time will do what time can do,  
Not erasing, just softening edges we move through.

Verse 2  
There was a day I had to see it through—  
Had to go through having the baby, too.  
Later came early, a shadow that blew  
In and out quickly, but it still was true.

Pre-Chorus  
For a while I folded the story from view,  
Because speaking too soon would reopen the bruise.

Chorus  
I’m not the only one aching in this room—  
He’s standing beside me, lost a child too.  
I carry the quiet; time will do what time can do,  
Not erasing, just softening edges we move through.

Bridge  
It’s been a horrible road, but I see now  
Family gathers and steadies the how.  
Helpless is heavy; we learned to allow  
Each other the space to breathe somehow.

Outro  
So I answer the letters, at least in my mind—  
Thank you for writing; it helps me find  
A gentler morning, a smaller truth:  
We’re walking it slowly, and time walks too.
