**\[Verse 1 -- warm, expressive female ONLY vocals with Southern soul
inflection\]**\
I had a melody growing inside me\
Soft as a whisper, strong as flame\
I wrote you lullabies for your first cries\
Wrote your story before I knew your name\
Hung the stars above a crib left hollow\
Sang to silence, held on tight\
The music stopped, but left its light\
And your echo stays through every night

**\[Chorus -- powerful female ONLY vocals, wide range, rich tone\]**\
Now you&#39;re still carried, an angel I can&#39;t hold\
Every word&#39;s a prayer, every note pure gold\
There&#39;s a rhythm in my sorrow, a heartbeat in the rain\
You&#39;re still carried, forever in my veins\
Yes, you&#39;re still carried... still carried again

**\[Verse 2 -- soulful female ONLY vocals with gospel undertones\]**\
They said &quot;these things just happen&quot;\
But that won&#39;t quiet the storm\
I lit a candle in the chapel\
And found my spirit reborn\
I had to mother my own spirit\
Before I could mother you\
Now I see you in each sunrise\
In everything I do

**\[Chorus -- powerful female ONLY vocals\]**\
You&#39;re still carried, an angel I&#39;ll always love\
Every word&#39;s a kiss I never gave enough\
There&#39;s a beauty in this broken, a healing in the pain\
You&#39;re still carried, in sunshine and rain\
Yes, you&#39;re still carried... still carried again

**\[Spoken Verse -- tender, introspective MALE only voice with gentle
rhythm\]**\
I know I missed the signs, lost in the grind\
You were hurting while I chased time\
I&#39;m sorry for the nights you cried\
For the dreams we built that never arrived\
But I&#39;ve learned this truth I hold so near:\
Love don&#39;t vanish --- it changes roots each year\
And you, my angel, are still carried here

**\[Bridge -- soulful female ONLY vocals, gentle vibrato\]**\
They say time will heal the hurting\
But I feel you in the breeze\
You&#39;re the hush between my verses\
You&#39;re the roots beneath my trees\
You&#39;re the shadow in my laughter\
You&#39;re the silence in my song\
You&#39;re the reason I keep singing\
You&#39;ve been with me all along

**\[Final Chorus -- soaring female ONLY vocals\]**\
You&#39;re still carried, an angel I still know\
Every word&#39;s a light, every note I sow\
There&#39;s a gospel in this grieving, a fire in the rain\
You&#39;re still carried --- in joy, in pain\
Yes, you&#39;re still carried... forever again

**\[Outro -- soft, almost whispered female vocal\]**\
Still carried... my angel... still carried again.

**Still Carried...An Angel&quot; -- A Song of Grief, Grace, and Eternal
Connection**

&quot;**Still Carried...An Angel**&quot; is a deeply emotional country ballad that
channels the raw vulnerability and spiritual resilience of a mother
mourning a child lost to miscarriage. Inspired by Beyonc&#233;&#39;s own
experience with pregnancy loss, the song is a tribute to the silent
strength of women who carry the memory of their children in their
hearts, even when they cannot carry them in their arms.

The song opens with a&#160;**warm, expressive female vocal**&#160;that evokes
Southern soul, setting the tone with poetic imagery: a melody growing
inside, lullabies written for a child never born, and stars hung above a
crib left hollow. These lines capture the bittersweet anticipation and
heartbreak of a pregnancy that ends too soon. The verse is tender yet
powerful, painting a picture of love that transcends physical presence.

The&#160;**chorus**&#160;swells with gospel-infused emotion, declaring that the
child is &quot;still carried&quot; --- not in the womb, but in spirit, in memory,
and in every heartbeat. The phrase becomes a mantra of remembrance,
transforming grief into a sacred rhythm. The use of&#160;**rich, wide-ranging
female vocals**&#160;adds a soaring, almost spiritual quality, reinforcing
the idea that love and loss are intertwined in a divine dance.

In the&#160;**second verse**, the lyrics confront the platitudes often
offered in times of loss --- &quot;these things just happen&quot; --- and reject
them in favor of spiritual rebirth. The mother lights a candle in a
chapel, symbolizing her journey toward healing. She learns to mother her
own spirit before she can mother the memory of her child, a profound
reflection on self-compassion and resilience.

A&#160;**spoken-word male verse**&#160;introduces a new perspective: the partner&#39;s
regret and introspection. Delivered with gentle rhythm and tenderness,
it acknowledges missed signs and emotional absence, offering a heartfelt
apology and a revelation --- that love doesn&#39;t disappear, it simply
changes form. This verse adds emotional complexity and balance, giving
voice to the often-unspoken grief of fathers.

The&#160;**bridge**&#160;is poetic and ethereal, likening the lost child to the
breeze, the hush between verses, and the roots beneath trees. These
metaphors suggest that the child&#39;s presence is woven into the fabric of
everyday life, invisible yet deeply felt. The&#160;**female vocals**&#160;here are
soft and soulful, with gentle vibrato that conveys both fragility and
strength.

The&#160;**final chorus**&#160;is a crescendo of emotion, affirming that the child
is &quot;still carried&quot; in joy and pain, in gospel and fire, in every note
sung and every word spoken. The song ends with a whispered outro ---
&quot;Still carried... my angel... still carried again&quot; --- a quiet
benediction that lingers like a prayer.
