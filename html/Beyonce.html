**Beyoncé**

**Still Carried\...An Angel**

*A country ballad with gospel undertones, emotional depth, and a tender
spoken-word verse*
Lyrics
**\[Verse 1 -- warm, expressive female ONLY vocals with Southern soul
inflection\]**\
I had a melody growing inside me\
Soft as a whisper, strong as flame\
I wrote you lullabies for your first cries\
Wrote your story before I knew your name\
Hung the stars above a crib left hollow\
Sang to silence, held on tight\
The music stopped, but left its light\
And your echo stays through every night

**\[Chorus -- powerful female ONLY vocals, wide range, rich tone\]**\
Now you're still carried, an angel I can't hold\
Every word's a prayer, every note pure gold\
There's a rhythm in my sorrow, a heartbeat in the rain\
You're still carried, forever in my veins\
Yes, you're still carried... still carried again

**\[Verse 2 -- soulful female ONLY vocals with gospel undertones\]**\
They said "these things just happen"\
But that won't quiet the storm\
I lit a candle in the chapel\
And found my spirit reborn\
I had to mother my own spirit\
Before I could mother you\
Now I see you in each sunrise\
In everything I do

**\[Chorus -- powerful female ONLY vocals\]**\
You're still carried, an angel I'll always love\
Every word's a kiss I never gave enough\
There's a beauty in this broken, a healing in the pain\
You're still carried, in sunshine and rain\
Yes, you're still carried... still carried again

**\[Spoken Verse -- tender, introspective MALE only voice with gentle
rhythm\]**\
I know I missed the signs, lost in the grind\
You were hurting while I chased time\
I'm sorry for the nights you cried\
For the dreams we built that never arrived\
But I've learned this truth I hold so near:\
Love don't vanish --- it changes roots each year\
And you, my angel, are still carried here

**\[Bridge -- soulful female ONLY vocals, gentle vibrato\]**\
They say time will heal the hurting\
But I feel you in the breeze\
You're the hush between my verses\
You're the roots beneath my trees\
You're the shadow in my laughter\
You're the silence in my song\
You're the reason I keep singing\
You've been with me all along

**\[Final Chorus -- soaring female ONLY vocals\]**\
You're still carried, an angel I still know\
Every word's a light, every note I sow\
There's a gospel in this grieving, a fire in the rain\
You're still carried --- in joy, in pain\
Yes, you're still carried... forever again

**\[Outro -- soft, almost whispered female vocal\]**\
Still carried... my angel... still carried again.

**Still Carried...An Angel" -- A Song of Grief, Grace, and Eternal
Connection**

"**Still Carried...An Angel**" is a deeply emotional country ballad that
channels the raw vulnerability and spiritual resilience of a mother
mourning a child lost to miscarriage. Inspired by Beyoncé's own
experience with pregnancy loss, the song is a tribute to the silent
strength of women who carry the memory of their children in their
hearts, even when they cannot carry them in their arms.

The song opens with a **warm, expressive female vocal** that evokes
Southern soul, setting the tone with poetic imagery: a melody growing
inside, lullabies written for a child never born, and stars hung above a
crib left hollow. These lines capture the bittersweet anticipation and
heartbreak of a pregnancy that ends too soon. The verse is tender yet
powerful, painting a picture of love that transcends physical presence.

The **chorus** swells with gospel-infused emotion, declaring that the
child is "still carried" --- not in the womb, but in spirit, in memory,
and in every heartbeat. The phrase becomes a mantra of remembrance,
transforming grief into a sacred rhythm. The use of **rich, wide-ranging
female vocals** adds a soaring, almost spiritual quality, reinforcing
the idea that love and loss are intertwined in a divine dance.

In the **second verse**, the lyrics confront the platitudes often
offered in times of loss --- "these things just happen" --- and reject
them in favor of spiritual rebirth. The mother lights a candle in a
chapel, symbolizing her journey toward healing. She learns to mother her
own spirit before she can mother the memory of her child, a profound
reflection on self-compassion and resilience.

A **spoken-word male verse** introduces a new perspective: the partner's
regret and introspection. Delivered with gentle rhythm and tenderness,
it acknowledges missed signs and emotional absence, offering a heartfelt
apology and a revelation --- that love doesn't disappear, it simply
changes form. This verse adds emotional complexity and balance, giving
voice to the often-unspoken grief of fathers.

The **bridge** is poetic and ethereal, likening the lost child to the
breeze, the hush between verses, and the roots beneath trees. These
metaphors suggest that the child's presence is woven into the fabric of
everyday life, invisible yet deeply felt. The **female vocals** here are
soft and soulful, with gentle vibrato that conveys both fragility and
strength.

The **final chorus** is a crescendo of emotion, affirming that the child
is "still carried" in joy and pain, in gospel and fire, in every note
sung and every word spoken. The song ends with a whispered outro ---
"Still carried... my angel... still carried again" --- a quiet
benediction that lingers like a prayer.
