### Style Descriptions

**200 Character Style**  
An aching, alternative-rock ballad with stripped guitar and piano, mirroring Megan’s poetic imagery of loss, goodbye, and the unbearable silence of miscarriage at “ten weeks and one day.”

**300 Character Style**  
Drawing from Megan Fox’s first-person poetry and interviews, this raw ballad blends alt-rock guitar with cinematic piano. It traces the arc from ultrasound wonder to devastating miscarriage, framed in stark, minimalistic verses. The chorus anchors on “ten weeks and one day,” her own words of time stopped.

### Song Description

_Ten Weeks and One Day_ follows Megan Fox’s lived testimony of miscarriage. Inspired by her interview statements about the pain being unlike anything she’d known, and by her own poetry vividly recounting ultrasound, farewell, and loss, the lyrics form a narrative arc. The structure begins with the fragile joy of seeing the baby’s image, then turns to the rupture of miscarriage, before closing on the aftermath of grief and unanswered questions.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
I saw your outline in the darkened screen,  
Ten weeks, one day, a fragile dream.  
I wanted to hold your hand, hear your laugh,  
A moment of forever I never had.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It sent me wandering, torn apart,  
A wild journey through my heart.

**[Chorus]**  
Ten weeks and one day,  
I had to let you go.  
My hands were empty,  
My voice was low.  
The silence remained,  
The pain wouldn’t stay away—  
Ten weeks and one day.

**[Verse 2]**  
They ripped you away from my insides,  
A goodbye I could never decide.  
I whispered ransom for your soul,  
But the price was higher than I could hold.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Nothing prepared me, no words could explain,  
How love can vanish, leave only pain.

**[Chorus]**  
Ten weeks and one day,  
I had to let you go.  
My hands were empty,  
My voice was low.  
The silence remained,  
The pain wouldn’t stay away—  
Ten weeks and one day.

**[Bridge]**  
I’ve never known a loss like this before,  
It split me open, shook my core.  
Together, apart, we both were changed,  
Love rearranged, love estranged.

**[Final Chorus]**  
Ten weeks and one day,  
I had to let you go.  
My hands were trembling,  
My voice was low.  
The silence heavy,  
The shadow will always stay—  
Ten weeks and one day.

**[Outro]**  
Goodbye came early, love stayed behind,  
A shadow carried through all of time.
