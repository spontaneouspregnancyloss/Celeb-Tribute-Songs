**🎵 Song 1: _“Seventeen Weeks”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Seventeen weeks, a name, a face,  
I held you close in that quiet place.  
Johnathan, you were small and still,  
But you filled my heart, you always will.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I took your photo, kissed your skin,  
Said goodbye with trembling chin.

**[Chorus]**  
Seventeen weeks, still my son,  
Seventeen weeks, still someone.  
You were loved from day one,  
Even though your life was done.

**[Verse 2]**  
My milk came in, no baby to feed,  
A mother’s ache, a silent need.  
I felt so lost, I felt so wrong,  
But you were wanted all along.

**[Bridge]**  
I hope you know you were enough,  
You were made of light and love.

**[Outro]**  
Seventeen weeks, still I cry,  
Seventeen weeks, no goodbye.
