### Style Descriptions

200 Character Style  
Dreamy indie-pop vignette: pulsing synth bed, airy vocals, scattered journal-like lines. Gentle beats underscore imagery of clocks, breath, and whiplash—fragmentary but tender, intimate, and raw.

300 Character Style  
Soft electronic pop layered with acoustic textures. Vocals hover over spacey synth pads, sparse beats, and piano fragments. The lyrics move like diary fragments—numbers, breaths, whiplash—each vignette forming part of a larger mosaic of loss and resilience.

### Song Description

A song built from Whitney Port’s own images: the sudden “whiplash” of shifting emotions, the clock of weeks and bloodwork, recording herself to find clarity, taking a breather before trying again. Each stanza is a vignette—breath, time, numbers—stitched into an intimate indie-pop fragment.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Two weeks out—  
I write the words I can barely say.  
Shock, then sadness, then relief,  
each one a wave that breaks and rolls away.

[Chorus]  
Emotional whiplash,  
I’m thrown from side to side.  
Shock to sadness to relief,  
I’m still breathing through the swing.

[Verse 2]  
Seven weeks, a waiting room,  
numbers rising, falling soon.  
Doctor cautious, screen is gray,  
I hold my breath till numbers say.

[Chorus]  
Emotional whiplash,  
I’m thrown from side to side.  
Shock to sadness to relief,  
I’m still breathing through the swing.

[Bridge]  
Turn on the mic,  
I speak before the feeling hides—  
A diary to hear myself,  
clarity about how I felt.

[Verse 3]  
I took a little breather,  
stepped outside the frame.  
Many roads lead forward,  
but I’m still the same.

[Outro]  
I am a mother, even in the empty space.  
Time won’t erase it—  
just teaches me to face.
