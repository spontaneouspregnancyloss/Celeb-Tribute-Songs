### Song Description

This narrative song traces Trina McGee's emotional journey: a "miracle" pregnancy at 54, unexpected miscarriage near the end of the first trimester, profound depression, and the spiritual resolution to let go of further anxiety and "let go and let God." It’s raw, honest, and deeply human, anchored in her own words.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
There was a miracle at fifty-four,  
A quiet dawn, a knocking at our door.  
You caught me unawares, a spark of grace,  
A whispered hope in my autumn space. ([People.com](https://people.com/boy-meets-world-trina-mcgee-reveals-pregnancy-loss-after-miracle-pregnancy-at-54-8716880?utm_source=chatgpt.com "\"Boy Meets World\"'s Trina McGee Reveals Miscarriage After 'Miracle' Pregnancy at 54: 'Very Hard to Face'"))

[Pre-Chorus]  
Then the first light faded, ending came too soon,  
I lost you close to that sweet morning’s noon. ([People.com](https://people.com/boy-meets-world-trina-mcgee-reveals-pregnancy-loss-after-miracle-pregnancy-at-54-8716880?utm_source=chatgpt.com "\"Boy Meets World\"'s Trina McGee Reveals Miscarriage After 'Miracle' Pregnancy at 54: 'Very Hard to Face'"))

[Chorus]  
Miracle, then midnight in my bones,  
Gratitude tangled deep in aching tones.  
I could barely rise, bed holding weight of sorrow,  
Yet love held me through the dark tomorrow.

[Verse 2]  
Depression rose like tide at dawn,  
Dragging me under…but I’m still holding on.  
There’s a fear in me that I won’t try again,  
Anxiety a shadow I don’t invite in.  
But in the silence, I hear gentle truth:  
Let go and let God—find our peace in that soothe.

[Pre-Chorus]  
We said we’ll keep loving, whether storms come or pass,  
Forging hope in breath, in the love that lasts.

[Chorus]  
Miracle, then midnight in my bones,  
Gratitude tangled deep in aching tones.  
I could barely rise, bed holding weight of sorrow,  
Yet love held me through the dark tomorrow.

[Bridge]  
Faith isn’t in the outcome, it’s in holding the hand,  
Of the one beside me—steady where I stand.  
If nothing more comes, still love remains our song,  
In grief and grace, together, we belong.

[Outro]  
Miracle, then midnight—but love is brighter than the night.  
We let go, we let God, and we keep holding tight.
