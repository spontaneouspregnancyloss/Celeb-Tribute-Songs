Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Sparse, imagistic folk-pop with mellow acoustic backdrop, natural phrasing, and gentle slant rhymes; voice is reverent, introspective, honoring Nicole’s own words—subtle, grounded, truthful.

300 Character Style  
An intimate, imagistic folk-pop piece with delicate guitar, light ambient tones, and soft, slanted rhymes. Language reflects first-person honesty, drawing on Nicole Kidman’s voice: “aching yearning,” “massive grief,” and the quiet “Ahhhh” of arrival—no invention, just reverberation.

Song Description  
This vignette-style lyric distills Nicole Kidman’s imagery and tone from her Tatler interviews (2018) and Marie Claire (2007). It uses her phrases like “aching yearning,” “massive grief,” “I know the yearning,” and “Ahhhh!” as atmospheric resonances—not impersonation, but respectful echo. It centers on emotional textures, moments of internal knowing, sorrow, and gentle emergence. It adheres to the brief: first-person, trauma-informed, grounded, non-speculative.

Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
In the hollow where a heartbeat stalled,  
a whisper echoes: yearning.  
Not loud—just a glass-thin ache,  
holding onto air I could not see.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know the yearning—aching as breath,  
silent but real.

[Chorus/Hook]  
In the ache, a whisper: “yearning.”  
In the hush, a grief not named—just carried.  
In the quiet, I felt that pull;  
in the stillness, I carried the yearning.

[Verse 2]  
A weight unspoken glides through me—  
massive grief in the space between words.  
I cradle absence like a secret song,  
learning to name it in gentle hums.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know the yearning—aching as breath,  
silent but real.

[Bridge]  
And after all that silence, comes a soft release:  
a breath, an “Ahhhh,” somewhere beyond the ache—  
a fragile return to light.

[Outro]  
So I hold the whisper and the hush,  
the yearning that is real.  
Carry it softly, as if it’s a name.
