**🎶 Genre: Classic Rock Ballad**

**🎼 Song 1: “Rocky” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “A few days later I was holding our little boy Rocky.”

**[Verse 1]**  
Just under twenty weeks,  
We thought we’d made it through.  
But life had other plans,  
And grief came crashing too.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Born with a heartbeat,  
Too little to survive.

**[Chorus]**  
Rocky, you were real,  
Held in our arms,  
Gone too soon,  
But never far.  
Rocky, you were strong,  
Even in the dark.

**[Verse 2]**  
We left the hospital empty,  
But you filled our hearts.

**[Bridge]**  
It still feels like yesterday,  
But you’re still part.

**[Outro]**  
Rocky,  
Forever ours.
