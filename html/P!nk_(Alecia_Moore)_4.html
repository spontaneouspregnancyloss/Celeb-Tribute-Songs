**Version 2 – Anthemic Ballad Lane (_Who Knew_, _Just Give Me a Reason_)**

Longer lyrical phrasing, piano/guitar swells, emotional arcs, sustained notes.

**[Verse 1]**  
Seventeen cut me open, a loss I couldn’t mend,  
My body broke its promise, the dream became the end.  
Carried silence heavy, it wrapped around my skin,  
Believed I was the failure buried deep within.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But every scar, every line, became my song to sing,  
A voice that rose from ashes, stronger than the sting.

**[Chorus]**  
Even broken, I am unbroken, singing louder than my pain,  
I’ve been shattered, bruised, and spoken, yet I rise again.  
I’ll write the darkest pieces, I’ll laugh through what I can,  
Even broken, I am unbroken—this is who I am.

**[Verse 2]**  
More than once I stumbled, more than once I bled,  
Each heartbreak whispered shadows, echoing my head.  
But therapy held the mirror, showed me what was real,  
Pulled the ghosts from silence, taught my soul to heal.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
So I bleed it on the paper, I sing it to the crowd,  
Owning every moment, I finally say it loud.

**[Chorus]**  
Even broken, I am unbroken, singing louder than my pain,  
I’ve been shattered, bruised, and spoken, yet I rise again.  
I’ll write the darkest pieces, I’ll laugh through what I can,  
Even broken, I am unbroken—this is who I am.

**[Bridge]**  
I joke when it’s too heavy, I cry when I can’t cope,  
Self-deprecation’s weapon still aims its laugh at hope.  
I’m not ashamed of bleeding, not ashamed of scars,  
The body that betrayed me still carried who we are.

**[Final Chorus – soaring]**  
Even broken, I am unbroken, my voice will not be tamed,  
Unashamed, alive, outspoken, rising through the flame.  
I’ll sing the darkest pieces, I’ll love through what I can,  
Even broken, I am unbroken—this is who I am.

**[Outro]**  
Even broken… still unbroken.  
Stronger for the pain.
