**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
Soft, intimate folk ballad with spare phrasing and gentle slant rhyme. Rooted in Rebecca’s own words: “completely floored,” “hated my body,” “no symptoms,” “held her.” Tone is grounded, compassionate, trauma-informed.

**300 Character Style**  
An emotive acoustic-folk song with quiet guitar, narrow octave melody, and natural phrasing that reflects Rebecca Adlington’s candor: she “could not stop crying for three days,” felt guilt, her body betrayed her—yet they “held her” baby Harper. No invented scenes, only deep honesty.

**Song Description**  
This narrative-style lyric captures Rebecca Adlington’s raw, public recounting of her 20-week miscarriage in 2023: the emotional breakdown, self-blame, body-image struggle, and the profound moment of holding her daughter, Harper. All lines trace to her direct quotes—whether in _This Morning_ segment (August 2025) or Instagram posts—and are framed without embellishment or speculation. Dr. Zoe Williams’s perspective adds context around silence and the importance of openness.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1]  
We went to the scan, expecting hope—  
and then no heartbeat, no answer why.  
“I couldn’t stop crying for three days,”  
my tears spoke what my voice could not say.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I followed every rule, blamed myself—  
“I was angry at my body. My body let me down.”

[Chorus / Hook]  
In the mirror, I wore the grief—  
still 20-week swollen, still carrying you.  
We held you, Harper, our angel, our breath—  
you were here, and we will always love you.

[Verse 2]  
No symptoms, and still—no warning given.  
I was floored, undone, caught in the silent collapse.  
The grief was private, heavy, unspoken—  
Dr. Zoe said too often, "we suffer in those first weeks in silence."

[Pre-Chorus]  
We swallow shame in that hush—  
but we must speak, to be less alone.

[Bridge]  
Dr. Zoe: “People often get on with it, no one knows…”  
We break the quiet by holding each other in words,  
not guilt, not blame—just shared sorrow.

[Outro]  
We carry you, Harper, in the ache and the hush—  
your absence traced in breath, in love.  
If silence weighs us down, then hold my voice—  
we speak for you, we are not alone.
