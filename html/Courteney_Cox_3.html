Lyrics
Verse 1  
I tried again and again—my heart kept returning.  
I get pregnant easy, but holding on was the hard part.  
I had a lot of miscarriages—each tiny dream fading,  
Yet I never thought I was supposed to be private.

Pre‑Chorus  
They never taught me this was pain we must shield,  
So I chose to speak, letting my story be real.

Chorus  
If my voice can carry wisdom or light,  
I’ll offer it gently through the quiet of night.  
There are days when the tears still find their way,  
But sharing our stories brings hope into the gray.

Verse 2  
I poured my heart into raw, honest stories,  
Each tear on camera—proof of my vulnerabilities.  
No episode escaped my tears’ trace,  
But I hope every raw moment offers someone grace.

Pre‑Chorus  
“Don’t hide your grief,” I tell myself, and you—  
Because you’re not alone. Let others hold you too.

Chorus  
If my voice can carry wisdom or light,  
I’ll offer it gently through the quiet of night.  
There are days when the tears still find their way,  
But sharing our stories brings hope into the gray.

Bridge  
No secret pain should stay alone in the dark—  
We find strength when every heart adds its spark.  
Let your grief be met with understanding, not shame,  
And let your longing find comfort in being named.

Outro  
So here—I stand open, heart on my sleeve,  
If my truth is your mirror, let it give you reprieve.  
You’re seen. You’re held. In shared grace we find reprieve.
