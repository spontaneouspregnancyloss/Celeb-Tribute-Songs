### Song Description

This vignette-style lyric captures **Trina McGee’s reflections** on grief, miracle, and faith. Using imagery rather than timeline, it conveys the emotional and spiritual texture of her miscarriage experience: shadows of loss, midnight as both grief and introspection, whispers of hope, and surrender to divine guidance. Language is trauma-informed, grounded in her own phrasing (“let go and let God,” gratitude, miracle pregnancy at 54).

### Lyrics

**Verse 1**  
Midnight shadows stretch and bend,  
Whispers of a miracle, then the end.  
Soft light drifts across the floor,  
Carrying echoes of what came before.

**Pre-Chorus**  
Grief flows like rivers in the night,  
Yet faith steadies, unseen, bright.

**Chorus (Hook)**  
Through shadows, through midnight,  
Love whispers—faith guides the way.  
Even when the morning feels far,  
Light blooms quietly where hearts are.

**Verse 2**  
Hands I cannot see hold mine,  
Cradling sorrow with a grace divine.  
A miracle, fleeting, yet wholly true,  
In each heartbeat, I find you.

**Pre-Chorus**  
Darkness folds but does not consume,  
Hope rises softly in the room.

**Chorus (Hook)**  
Through shadows, through midnight,  
Love whispers—faith guides the way.  
Even when the morning feels far,  
Light blooms quietly where hearts are.

**Bridge**  
Letting go is not giving in,  
It’s finding strength beneath the skin.  
Miracles linger in the tender air,  
In every breath, in every prayer.

**Outro**  
Midnight fades, yet love remains,  
Sorrow and grace in equal chains.  
Faith carries, unseen yet near,  
Love whispers softly, always here.
