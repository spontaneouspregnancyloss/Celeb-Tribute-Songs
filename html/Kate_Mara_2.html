**🎵 Song 2: _“Dragged Out”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
The days blurred into weeks,  
Hope turned into ache.  
I waited for the ending,  
But it wouldn’t break.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I was pregnant, but not really,  
Still I felt the weight.  
A cruel trick of biology,  
A slow and silent fate.

**[Chorus]**  
Dragged out, like a storm that never clears,  
Dragged out, through the quiet and the tears.  
I held on, though I didn’t understand,  
What it means to lose without a hand.

**[Verse 2]**  
I didn’t know the terms,  
But I knew the pain.  
I searched for answers,  
But none came.

**[Bridge]**  
Even false beginnings leave a mark,  
Even empty arms feel dark.

**[Outro]**  
Dragged out, still I grieve,  
Dragged out, still believe.
