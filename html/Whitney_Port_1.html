Style Descriptions

200 Character Style  
Soft indie-pop confession with conversational lines, light rhymes, and a calm, steady pulse—built for close-mic vocal, warm electric piano, and subtle drums, centering clarity over ornament.

300 Character Style  
A restrained, modern pop ballad that moves like a journal entry—gentle keys, a rounded bass, and pocket drums. Lines pivot between past and present, tracing fear, relief, guilt, and resolve, with a chorus that comforts without overselling hope.

Song Description  
A first-person timeline from disclosure (“two weeks ago…”) through the swing of feelings (“emotional whiplash”), a later seven-week update with waiting on numbers, the choice to speak publicly, and pausing to take “a little breather.” It closes by affirming many paths to motherhood and solidarity with anyone who needs to feel less alone.

Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Two weeks out, I say it plain, no flourish, no disguise,  
I count the days and name the loss that caught me by surprise.  
Inside my skin I picture things I wish I couldn’t see,  
Another Sonny’s shadow flickers, not a future meant for me. ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))

[Pre-Chorus]  
Relief shows up, then shame for it, and then I second-guess,  
I talk it through in whispers till the knot inside says “yes.” ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))

[Chorus]  
I’m still a mother, carrying what didn’t stay,  
One breath, one step—just taking it day by day.  
If feeling two things at once is how the heart survives,  
I’ll hold the yes and no of it, and keep my hands unclenched and wide. ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))

[Verse 2]  
Seven weeks along, a room, a screen, a doctor’s measured tone,  
He’s cautious; I’m awaiting numbers, bracing at the phone.  
I speak it out the moment that I learn which way it goes,  
A raw diary for clarity when language finally knows. ([People.com](https://people.com/parents/whitney-port-on-recording-reaction-after-third-miscarriage-exclusive/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Whitney Port on Recording Reaction After Her Third ..."))

[Pre-Chorus]  
Relief and grief keep trading places, neither asks to win,  
I breathe and let the tide go out, then feel it rush back in. ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))

[Chorus]  
I’m still a mother, carrying what didn’t stay,  
One breath, one step—just taking it day by day.  
If feeling two things at once is how the heart survives,  
I’ll hold the yes and no of it, and keep my hands unclenched and wide. ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))

[Bridge]  
The stats don’t heal, but knowing I’m not singular is kind,  
Speaking so that someone else feels seen reorders my mind.  
We took a little breather when the trying turned to ache,  
Then named the paths we’re open to, whatever love may make.

[Outro]  
So here I am, no promises, no timeline to obey—  
I’m still a mother, learning how to carry what didn’t stay. ([Refinery29](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8384711/whitney-port-miscarriage-lessons "Whitney Port: 5 Things I Learned From My Miscarriage"))
