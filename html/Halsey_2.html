**🎼 Song 2: “Backstage Bleeding” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “I performed that night with a towel between my legs.”

**[Verse 1]**  
Spotlight on my face,  
Blood beneath the lace.  
I didn’t cancel,  
I didn’t cry.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I sang through the pain,  
And didn’t ask why.

**[Chorus]**  
Backstage bleeding,  
Still believing.  
Backstage broken,  
Still outspoken.

**[Verse 2]**  
Three times I lost,  
But never gave in.

**[Bridge]**  
My body was a battlefield,  
But I still win.

**[Outro]**  
Backstage bleeding,  
Still beginning.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Backstage bleeding / Still believing”_
