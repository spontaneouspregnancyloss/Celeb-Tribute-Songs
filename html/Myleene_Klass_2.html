**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
Gentle piano and soft strings under a heartfelt vocal. Rhymes sharpened—ABAB in verses, echoing consonants and internal rhyme in chorus—grounded, calm, emotionally tethered.

**300 Character Style**  
A refined classical-pop vignette: sparse piano with subtle strings provides atmosphere while tight rhymes—like bloom/gloom, hush/brush—create musical cohesion. The chorus’s rhythmic symmetry heightens the emotional invitation to speak.

**Song Description**  
An imagistic, first-person piece using only Myleene Klass's own public, first-person accounts of miscarriage: the scan abroad, quiet loss, public composure, “missed miscarriage,” the clinical process, and her aim to speak so that “even one lost soul” might feel seen. Now fully rhymed in tight patterns without adding any invented scenes or speculation.

**Lyrics**  
[Verse 1]  
In a room where hope began to bloom,  
a fragile pulse awoke from gloom.  
Then vanished—leaving silence and hush,  
no whispered comfort, not even a brush.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I sat in stillness, sorrow’s quiet art—  
a weight unspoken, inside my heart.

[Chorus (Hook)]  
Let us speak the unspoken, so we’re not broken,  
name the love lost, the vow we never spoken.  
If speaking brings just one lost soul back from night,  
then I’ll carry the light—and speak what’s right.

[Verse 2]  
I felt the tide though the signal was low,  
kept calm on air, though grief edged through my show.  
Silent thunder reverberated beneath,  
I carried on—though I couldn’t find relief.

[Pre-Chorus]  
My body betrayed me, still and unknown,  
the beat was gone, but the form remained alone.

[Bridge]  
Forms inked in hush, clinical scripts on page,  
containing grief more aged than any cage.  
In hallways where joy and sorrow intertwine,  
I learned how fragile a single word can define.

[Outro]  
I’ll keep a lamp within my window’s glow,  
for those still wandering, moving soft and slow.  
If one lost soul can find shared ground in this song,  
then speaking the unspoken will carry us along.
