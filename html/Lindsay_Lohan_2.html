Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
White sheets, drawn blinds  
A tray untouched by time  
The silence filled the hallway  
And I didn’t say a word

**Pre-Chorus**  
I was sick, not just tired  
A weight I couldn’t name  
Two weeks slipped through my fingers  
And nothing felt the same

**Chorus**  
Hotel silence / no one knew  
But I did / I always do  
It’s a very long story  
That never made the news

**Verse 2**  
The mirror didn’t ask  
The phone stayed dark  
I curled into the quiet  
And let it leave its mark

**Pre-Chorus**  
No one knows this, not allowed  
But it happened, and it stays  
In the hush between my headlines  
And the roles I had to play

**Chorus**  
Hotel silence / no one knew  
But I did / I always do  
It’s a very long story  
That never made the news

**Bridge**  
I said it once, just once aloud  
Then let it drift into the cloud  
Still carried, still unseen  
Still part of who I’ve been

**Outro**  
Hotel silence / still in my skin  
A secret loss / I hold within
