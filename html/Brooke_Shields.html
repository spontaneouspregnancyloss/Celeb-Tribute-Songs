**ðŸŽ¶ Track Title: *Twelve Hours***

**Inspired by**: Brooke Shields' miscarriage following IVF\
**Project**: SPL Project

**Lyrics**

**\[Verse 1 -- soft piano intro, voice should sound weary but
composed\]**\
In my mid-thirties, I tried to heal,\
A biopsy carved what time would steal.\
Scarred and shortened, my body changed,\
But no one warned what that arranged.

**\[Verse 2 -- build with strings, voice should carry quiet
frustration\]**\
We tried through science, through hope and pain,\
A catheter blocked, they tried again.\
Through my belly, life was placed,\
And for a moment, joy embraced.

**\[Pre-Chorus -- gentle vocal rise, emphasize emotional tension\]**\
Three months in, the light grew dim,\
A silent shift, a violent hymn.\
I asked if scar tissue screamed,\
As my body tore through dreams.

**\[Chorus -- soaring melody, voice should sound raw but steady\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
A loss so aching,\
No room for desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.

**\[Verse 3 -- return to minimal instrumentation, voice should sound
introspective\]**\
No one said this could unfold,\
That healing could leave me cold.\
Had I known, I might have swayed,\
Made choices that better stayed.

**\[Pre-Chorus -- repeat with slight variation, add harmony\]**\
I asked if pain had memory,\
If stretching scars could set me free.\
But answers came too late,\
In the shadow of fate.

**\[Chorus -- repeat with layered vocals and strings\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
A loss so aching,\
No room for desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.

**\[Bridge -- spoken word option or whispered vocals\]**\
This was not a choice I made,\
But a truth I had to face.\
And in the silence of that night,\
I became someone else.

**\[Final Chorus -- stripped down, voice should sound resolved\]**\
Twelve hours of breaking,\
Twelve hours of fire.\
But I rose from aching,\
With a quiet, fierce desire.\
You were real, you were near,\
In the echo of my fear---\
And I carry you still,\
Through twelve hours of pain.
