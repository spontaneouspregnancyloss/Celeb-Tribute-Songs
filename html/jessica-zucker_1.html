**🎵 Song 1: _“Sixteen Weeks”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Sixteen weeks, a heartbeat strong,  
Then silence came and proved me wrong.  
I held the hope, I held the dream,  
But life unraveled at the seam.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I cut the cord myself,  
No one else.  
My milk came in,  
But no baby cried.

**[Chorus]**  
Sixteen weeks, then goodbye,  
Sixteen weeks, no lullaby.  
I didn’t sugarcoat the pain,  
I spoke the truth, again and again.

**[Verse 2]**  
I said the words,  
Many times.  
I wrote the grief,  
In quiet rhymes.

**[Bridge]**  
Even when the world moved on,  
I stayed with you, I stayed strong.

**[Outro]**  
Sixteen weeks, still I bleed,  
Sixteen weeks, still I need.
