### Lyrics

[Verse 1 — soft guitar and gentle piano, intimate female vocal]  
I felt the years slipping faster than I could hold,  
Stopped letting myself hope, because time had worn the edges.  
It wasn’t impossible—I just didn’t think it likely,  
So I whispered to myself that maybe it’s not meant for me.

[Pre-Chorus — subtle swell, soft strings]  
I said it out loud—maybe I’m not entitled,  
Maybe what I already have was always enough.

[Chorus / Hook — warm full vocal, add light harmony]  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly,  
Grateful for the goodness I get to keep close,  
I learned to protect my heart with gentle words,  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly.

[Verse 2 — guitar stay, piano fills]  
Blessings in hand, yet breath caught on what might have been,  
Told myself it was okay—peace in a quiet refrain,  
A defense built from tenderness, not expecting more,  
But longing for a sibling felt in every soft moment.

[Bridge — stripped back to piano, voice soft]  
Later I understood—that mindset was my shield,  
A way to pause heartbreak before it had a chance to bloom.  
In that gentle preparation, I found grace in acceptance,  
And gratitude for the life I already held close.

[Chorus-Outro — return full band softly, fade]  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly,  
Thankful for a gift I never thought I’d see,  
I nurture it softly—even if it never comes,  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly.
