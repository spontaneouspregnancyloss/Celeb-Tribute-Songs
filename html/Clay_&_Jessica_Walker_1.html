Song Description
A reflective country ballad capturing Clay Walker’s personal journey through miscarriage—from hopeful preparation through devastating loss, using familiar imagery (nursery, 13‑week movement) and raw emotional candor (“helpless,” “run over by a train”). It emphasizes a husband’s powerless compassion, the persistence of faith, and the search for meaning in grief.

Lyrics
Verse 1  
I remember setting clothes on the shelf—  
A perfect name ready: Eleanora Lindsey—  
We’d made it past the hardest weeks…  
The nursery glowed with promise and prayers.

Pre‑Chorus  
At thirteen weeks, she moved—acrobat in the dark—  
Our laughter filled quiet rooms, hope unfurled.

Chorus  
I stood helpless as a husband and father,  
Couldn’t shield her heart or the child inside.  
It felt like being run over by a train,  
A loss we’d prepared for, yet unprepared to face.

Verse 2  
The whole family had been waiting for her smile,  
A sixth heartbeat to complete the circle.  
But in that silence, the nightmare whispered,  
“Still is for my wife,” a grief I share.

Pre‑Chorus  
I ask, how do mothers carry that weight?  
Pain so, so deep—I still don’t know how.

Chorus  
I stood helpless as a husband and father,  
Couldn’t shield her heart or the child inside.  
It felt like being run over by a train,  
A loss we’d prepared for, yet unprepared to face.

Bridge  
I never asked God “why” when MS came.  
But this question…  
It will be my first in heaven’s quiet.  
No understanding, just prayer inside.

Outro  
So I hold our quiet rooms  
And the memory of motion—acrobat hope—  
In the hush after the storm,  
I pray we find our way back to peace.
