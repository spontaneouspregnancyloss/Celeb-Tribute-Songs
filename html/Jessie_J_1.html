**üéµ Song 1: _‚ÄúComes in Waves‚Äù_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Intro]**  
It comes in waves,  
Like I‚Äôm drowning in love I crave.

**[Verse 1]**  
I woke up wrong, I felt the shift,  
The silence came, no heartbeat lift.  
I sang that night, I wore the light,  
But inside, nothing felt right.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I had no one to turn to,  
No hand to hold.  
I kept the show going,  
But I felt cold.

**[Chorus]**  
Comes in waves,  
Like thunder in my chest.  
Comes in waves,  
No time to rest.  
I lost you,  
But I still confess.

**[Verse 2]**  
I wrote a song, I kept it close,  
A demo filled with ghost.  
You slipped away,  
But lit the way.

**[Bridge]**  
We are allowed to be broken,  
To sit in the pain.  
We are allowed to be silent,  
And still remain.

**[Outro]**  
Comes in waves,  
But I‚Äôm still here.
