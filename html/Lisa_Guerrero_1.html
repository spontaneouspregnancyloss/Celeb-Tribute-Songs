Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
The lights were hot, the mic was live  
I stood there, trying to survive  
A story to tell, a role to play  
But something inside slipped away

**Pre-Chorus**  
I was bleeding on camera  
No one saw, no one knew  
I didn’t tell a soul  
I just did what I had to do

**Chorus**  
I had to finish the segment  
Though my body was breaking down  
I smiled through the silence  
And swallowed the sound

**Verse 2**  
The script kept rolling  
My voice stayed clear  
But inside I was crumbling  
And no one was near

**Pre-Chorus**  
I didn’t tell anyone  
Not the crew, not the floor  
I held it like a secret  
Behind a closing door

**Chorus**  
I had to finish the segment  
Though my body was breaking down  
I smiled through the silence  
And swallowed the sound

**Bridge**  
They call it strength, I call it survival  
A moment that rewrote my arrival  
I learned what silence costs  
And what it means to carry loss

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unseen  
Still part of where I’ve been
