**🎼 Song 2: “Prisoner of Hope” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “My body has been a prisoner.”

**[Verse 1]**  
Needles, charts, and whispered dreams,  
A body caught in time.  
I’ve lived between the cycles,  
Of heartbreak and design.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I told the world,  
Then watched it fade.

**[Chorus]**  
Prisoner of hope,  
Still holding on.  
Prisoner of love,  
Even when it’s gone.

**[Verse 2]**  
Eight or nine,  
I lost the count.

**[Bridge]**  
But every loss,  
Still speaks aloud.

**[Outro]**  
Prisoner of hope,  
Still proud.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Prisoner of hope / Still holding on”_
