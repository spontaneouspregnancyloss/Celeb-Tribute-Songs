**200 Character Style**  
A gentle, honest folk-style refrain tracing quiet heartbreak and the strength in naming the pain, grounded in one woman's own voice.

**300 Character Style**  
A reflective first-person folk-style piece that traces a moment of loss—finding a positive test, then loss, then deep isolation—before naming a shared truth that breaks the silence and opens a path toward collective comfort.

**Song Description**  
This song follows the trajectory of that initial hopeful moment, the crushing emotional aftermath of miscarriage, the loneliness she describes, and finally the resolve to speak out so others feel seen and less alone. Themes include quiet grief, the personal burden of silence, and the healing power of shared truth.

**Lyrics**  
_Verse 1_  
I held that little line in trembling light,  
A thrill of hope, the world receded,  
Then quietly, the joy slipped away by night,  
I was left in darkness, unshielded.

_Pre-Chorus_  
Alone in the ache beneath my ribs,  
A soft collapse where hope once lived.

_Chorus (Hook)_  
I felt like I failed—until I learned we’re not alone,  
We sit in our own pain—we don’t need to sit by ourselves, unknown.

_Verse 2_  
I felt lost, as if my body had betrayed,  
Silence sealed the space where grief stayed,  
But words can crack the fortress built inside,  
I’ll speak this truth so sorrow won’t hide.

_Bridge_  
No more silent shame, no need to bear it in the dark,  
If I bring light with my voice, we all can mend this spark.

_Outro_  
I felt like I failed—but I’m not broken, no—  
Maybe together we’ll heal, by letting our quiet voices grow.
