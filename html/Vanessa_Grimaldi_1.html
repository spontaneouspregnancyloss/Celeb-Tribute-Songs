### Style Descriptions

200 Character Style  
Acoustic folk vignette with hushed vocals, finger-picked guitar, soft echo. Lyrics drift like diary entries: spirals, waves, lanterns of shared stories. Intimate, tender, full of breath and space.

300 Character Style  
Indie-folk ballad, anchored by nylon-string guitar and whispered harmonies. Each vignette is a diary fragment: joy into loss, grief as spirals, community voices as lanterns. Sparse but poignant, with silences carrying as much weight as the words.

### Song Description

A vignette-style song shaped from Vanessa Grimaldi’s words: the joy of expecting, the devastation of miscarriage, leaning on her partner, and the nonlinear nature of grief. Each stanza is a tender diary entry: gratitude, sorrow, and solidarity woven together.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Overjoyed with the first light,  
we whispered names in secret rooms.  
Heartbeat imagined, silence came,  
joy turned quickly into gloom.

[Chorus]  
Grieving is not linear,  
some days are heavy, some are clear.  
Every day a different wave,  
leaning on love, we try to stay.

[Verse 2]  
It hit me harder than I thought,  
tears where laughter used to start.  
We leaned on each other, hands entwined,  
holding space for broken hearts.

[Chorus]  
Grieving is not linear,  
some days are heavy, some are clear.  
Every day a different wave,  
leaning on love, we try to stay.

[Bridge]  
Lanterns glow from stories shared,  
I hear your voices in the air.  
Community holding me through,  
gratitude and sorrow, both are true.

[Verse 3]  
Every step, a spiral path,  
grief and healing intertwine.  
I carry what I hoped for,  
and all that’s left behind.

[Outro]  
Overjoyed, devastated—  
still we walk, still we breathe.  
In the not-so-straight line,  
we find the strength to grieve.
