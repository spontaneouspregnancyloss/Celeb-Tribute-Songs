**"The Light Between (Female Vocals)"**

*(Narrative Arc -- Draft 1)*

**\[Epigraph -- Seed Phrase\]**\
*"The film took on a new meaning"*
Lyrics
**\[Verse 1\]**\
I stepped into a story, not knowing it was mine\
Lines on a page, a mother's silent cry\
We filmed the loss, I played the part\
But life would echo back into my heart

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
No script could hold the weight I'd feel\
When fiction blurred with something real

**\[Chorus\]**\
It was extreme, it was pain\
Not just in body, but in name\
I tried to speak, to not pretend\
To let the silence find its end\
If someone's out there feeling this\
Know you're not alone in it

**\[Verse 2\]**\
The lights went down, the cameras rolled\
But off the set, the truth took hold\
I carried hope, then let it go\
No one prepares you for that shadow

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
But I won't let it disappear\
The ache deserves to reappear

**\[Chorus\]**\
It was extreme, it was pain\
Not just in body, but in name\
I tried to speak, to not pretend\
To let the silence find its end\
If someone's out there feeling this\
Know you're not alone in it

**\[Bridge\]**\
I found myself inside the frame\
A role that bore my hidden name\
And though the world may never see\
The quiet grief that lives in me

**\[Outro\]**\
So here I am, not whole, not gone\
Still walking through what I leaned on\
The light between what was and is\
Still flickers in the life I miss

**"Open Silence (Female Vocals)"**

**\[Epigraph -- Seed Phrase\]**\
*"I tried to be open about it"*

**\[Verse 1\]**\
A quiet ache beneath the skin\
No camera caught the moment in\
The role I played, the lines I knew\
But grief rewrote the script I drew

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
A shadow passed, not seen, not named\
Still every breath recalls that flame

**\[Chorus\]**\
Open silence, soft and raw\
No need to hide what I saw\
Pain that whispered, not for show\
Still I let the silence go\
If you've felt this, hold it near\
You're not alone inside that tear

**\[Verse 2\]**\
The ocean light, the island breeze\
Held echoes of what wouldn't be\
A mother's hope, a fragile thread\
Unspoken words I never said

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
I didn't plan to live that part\
But life had other ways to start

**\[Chorus\]**\
Open silence, soft and raw\
No need to hide what I saw\
Pain that whispered, not for show\
Still I let the silence go\
If you've felt this, hold it near\
You're not alone inside that tear

**\[Bridge\]**\
Art became a mirror's face\
Reflecting loss I couldn't trace\
And though the world may never know\
I carry light where love won't go

**\[Outro\]**\
So here I stand, not asking why\
Just letting truth and time pass by\
Open silence, still it stays\
A part of me in quiet ways
