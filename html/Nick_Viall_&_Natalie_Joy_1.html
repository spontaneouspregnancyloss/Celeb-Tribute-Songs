**Title:** Holding Hope in the Waiting

\[Verse 1 *soft electric piano + fingerpicked electric guitar\]*\
Cold night, winter sky, the promise slipped away\
We held on to each heartbeat, 'til it all turned grey\
January's heavy, echoes of your cry\
I reached into the shadows, just to say goodbye

\[Pre-Chorus -- male--female duet *light snare + airy backing vocals\]*\
In the still, our grief became the tune\
We sang what hurt, under a pale, sad moon

\[Chorus -- male--female duet *full band, warm bass + violin\]*\
Holding hope in the waiting, when every door feels closed\
Finding light in the quiet, where only love can grow\
We're chasing down the answers, afraid but reaching through\
Our hearts keep on beating, in the space between the truth

\[Verse 2 *drop to groove + light organ pad\]*\
March brought broken dreams, and names we couldn't speak\
Still we climbed that mountain, though the air was thin and weak\
You held your pain with fire, so steady, so brave\
I stood there like the shoreline, holding back the wave

\[Pre-Chorus -- male--female duet *kick + harmony swell\]*\
In that echo, we found a fragile flame\
Through the tears and the laughter, love stayed the same

\[Chorus -- male--female duet *guitar layers + harmony lift + violin\]*\
Holding hope in the waiting, when faith feels far away\
We're resting in the healing, praying for another day\
Tests may bring the answers---or stories that just scare\
But our love keeps on burning, when nothing else is fair

\[Bridge -- male--female duet *strip to bass + toms, slow build\]*\
We found strength in the trying, truth in every tear\
In River's gentle laughter, hope feels near\
Loss can pull us under, fear can call our name\
But we'll hold on to the future, and rise through the flame

\[Breakdown *acoustic guitar + low harmony hums\]*\
No shame in this sorrow, no shame in the fall\
Your body fought a battle, but love outshines it all

\[Chorus -- Final, with build -- male--female duet *band swells,
tambourine + big harmonies\]*\
Holding hope in the waiting, leaning hard on what's real\
You're healing in the quiet, and every wound will heal\
We're walking through the darkness, afraid but shining through\
Our hearts keep on beating---'til the day we meet our "new"

\[Outro *fade to clean guitar + electric piano\]*\
Holding hope in the waiting\
Holding hope in the waiting

Soulful '70s rock with modern pop polish, mid-tempo 80 BPM, warm bass,
layered clean guitars, soft electric organ, violin, rich harmonies,
tender yet anthemic build.

**Description**: *Holding Hope in the Waiting\"* is an intimate
male--female duet written in honor of **Nick Viall and Natalie Joy**,
who have bravely shared their journey through repeated pregnancy loss.
With soft piano, gentle guitar, and warm strings, the song carries
listeners through moments of deep sorrow, whispered resilience, and
fragile hope. Each verse captures the quiet, often unseen struggle of
grieving while holding onto love, faith, and the dream of new life.
Inspired by their openness and strength, it's both a lament and a
promise: that even in the darkest seasons, love remains a steady light,
and hope can still grow in the space between heartbreak and renewal.
