**🎵 Song 2: _“Every Second”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Every second of my life was new,  
My body changed, my mind did too.  
I thought of choice, I thought of fate,  
I thought of love that came too late.

**[Chorus]**  
Every second, I remembered,  
What it meant to lose.  
Every second, I surrendered,  
To a truth I didn’t choose.

**[Verse 2]**  
I had a great pregnancy,  
But the past still spoke.  
Two losses carved their names,  
In every breath I broke.

**[Bridge]**  
I was alone, I was afraid,  
But I found the strength to stay.

**[Outro]**  
Every second,  
Still carries you today.
