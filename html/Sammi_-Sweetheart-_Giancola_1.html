### Song Description

This song is grounded in Sammi Giancola’s own words from her public disclosures about miscarriage during IVF (“long process,” “magical moment,” “devastating,” fiancé’s support). Interweaving her pop-forward, heartfelt persona, and in absence of direct quotes on musical taste, I infer a musical style that blends gentle acoustic-pop with emotional clarity—inviting connection—aligned with her relatable, honest presence.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1 — intimate female vocals, soft guitar + ambient synth pad]  
I counted each shot like a whispered prayer,  
Every hormone pulse held a promise in the air,  
I felt the glow of something beautiful,  
Then watched it slip away—left with a hollow ache.

[Pre-Chorus — piano enters gently, vocal warmth grows]  
It was magical, even just to believe,  
And when it was gone, it shattered silently.

[Chorus / Hook — fuller ambient bloom, gentle percussion]  
Magical thought—then heartbreak—but hope stayed,  
You stood beside me through each wave,  
In the grief, I found a deeper kind of grace,  
Magical thought—then heartbreak—but hope stayed.

[Verse 2 — guitar + piano interplay]  
All those moments in the sterile light,  
Felt too raw for words, too harsh for sight,  
Yet your arms reminded me I wasn’t alone,  
We held each other, even when hope felt unknown.

[Bridge — stripped to ambient synth + voice, reflective tone]  
In the shadow of loss, I learned what strength can be—  
Quiet, fierce, and gently rooted in love’s memory,  
That tiny spark may fade, but doesn’t disappear,  
Because you were there—I still feel you near.

[Chorus-Outro — layered vocals, full instrumentals with soft fade]  
Magical thought—then heartbreak—but hope stayed,  
Even when the world felt dark and frayed,  
Together I hold the lesson in this ache,  
Magical thought—then heartbreak—but hope stayed.
