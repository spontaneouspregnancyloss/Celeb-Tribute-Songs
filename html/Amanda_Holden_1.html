> **ðŸŽ¶ Full Song (Draft 2 -- Vignette Style)**
>
> **Title:** *Candle for You*
>Lyrics
> **Verse 1 (soft, spacious --- piano only)**
>
> A chair by the window, afternoon light,\
> Quiet coats on hooks, everything slight.\
> My hands remember the weight of your name,\
> Peace on your face that softened the flame.
>
> **Pre-Chorus (gentle rise, strings enter)**
>
> I meet that day like a doorway of air,\
> Step through gently... you're always there.
>
> **Chorus (hook, melodic and resonant)**
>
> Candle for you, and I breathe it in,\
> Love doesn't end, it just learns to begin.\
> I keep you close in the simplest way---\
> Part of our family, every day.
>
> **Verse 2 (piano + light strings, warm)**
>
> Nurses with steadiness, kind, unhurried hands,\
> Holding us steady when nothing stands.\
> Their care stitched hours that had come apart,\
> Gratitude lives at the root of my heart.
>
> **Pre-Chorus (repeat with more lift)**
>
> When your day returns, I mark the year,\
> Do something good because you were here.
>
> **Chorus (stronger, orchestral build)**
>
> Candle for you, and I breathe it in,\
> Love doesn't end, it just learns to begin.\
> I keep you close in the simplest way---\
> Part of our family, every day.
>
> **Bridge (intimate, hushed, candle imagery)**
>
> Some words still bruise like a shadowed glass,\
> But soft words carried us safely past.\
> And even now, when I thank them out loud,\
> I'm thanking you, too, in the fold of the crowd.
>
> **Chorus (final, soaring --- full arrangement)**
>
> Candle for you, and I breathe it in,\
> Love doesn't end, it just learns to begin.\
> I keep you close in the simplest way---\
> Part of our family, every day.
>
> **Outro (fade, piano & solo string)**
>
> I carry your peace like a hidden thread,\
> Stitching the living to what we said.
