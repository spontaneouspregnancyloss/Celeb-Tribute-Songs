Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
Twelve weeks / a quiet line  
No heartbeat / no sign  
I folded the news into silence  
And walked into the day

**Pre-Chorus**  
The studio lights were humming  
My smile was practiced, thin  
I didn’t know how to grieve  
So I kept it all within

**Chorus**  
Twelve weeks of silence  
And no one saw the ache  
I wore my voice like clothing  
And never let it break

**Verse 2**  
The headlines moved around me  
The laughter filled the air  
But I was somewhere distant  
In a place too raw to share

**Pre-Chorus**  
I went back to work the next day  
Like nothing had gone wrong  
But something left me quietly  
And I’ve carried it so long

**Chorus**  
Twelve weeks of silence  
And no one saw the ache  
I wore my voice like clothing  
And never let it break

**Bridge**  
It was incredibly lonely  
To hold what had no name  
No cradle, no goodbye  
Just a shadow and a flame

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unknown  
A story I call my own
