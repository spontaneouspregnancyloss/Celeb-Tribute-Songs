## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
Sunlight on my skin,  
But shadows in my chest.  
I wear the dress, I wear the grin,  
But I’m not at my best.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Plans we made, now folded small,  
In drawers I can’t open at all.

**[Chorus]**  
Behind the smile is heartbreak,  
Behind the eyes, a storm.  
I’m learning how to carry  
What never got to form.

**[Verse 2]**  
I don’t want to pretend,  
That everything’s okay.  
I’m walking through the silence,  
Day by day.

**[Bridge]**  
You are not alone,  
Even when it feels that way.

**[Outro]**  
Behind the smile, I’m healing,  
In my own quiet way.
```
