**🎵 Song 2: _“No Baby to Feed”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
The crib stayed empty,  
But my body prepared.  
I felt so alone,  
So unprepared.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I didn’t fail, though it felt that way,  
I carried you every day.

**[Chorus]**  
No baby to feed, but love remains,  
No baby to hold, but I still claim  
Your name, your place, your light, your grace.

**[Verse 2]**  
Johnathan, you were real,  
A truth I’ll always feel.

**[Bridge]**  
I speak your story so others heal,  
I show the world what’s raw and real.

**[Outro]**  
No baby to feed, still I grieve,  
No baby to feed, still believe.
