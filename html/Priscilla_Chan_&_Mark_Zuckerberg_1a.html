Lyrics — **Draft 2 (Imagistic / Vignette)**  
[Verse 1 — female vocal, piano arpeggio + distant cello]  
Lights in the hallway blink like small apologies,  
Waiting rooms keep time with a slow breath,  
A single folded hope in my hands felt heavy,  
I learned the hush can sound like thunder.

[Pre-Chorus — breathy harmonies, soft tabla or brushed snare]  
I thought the dark was only mine to hold,  
But voices came back, soft as neighbor’s light.

[Chorus / Hook — strings swell, vocal doubles]  
[Chorus] There are really dark moments — I know them,  
[Chorus] But you are not alone beneath that sky,  
[Chorus] Names spoken in the quiet make the night smaller,  
[Chorus] You are not alone — we are in this together.

[Verse 2 — fingerpicked guitar, warm Rhodes piano]  
Small revelations: other footsteps on the stairs,  
Stories reaching out like lamps in fog,  
We learned that silence breaks when we say the word,  
And in the breaking, another door can open.

[Bridge — stripped back, solo piano + intimate vocal]  
I keep a ledger of the tender and the hard,  
I keep the goodness we were given close,  
Speaking was the first small map out of the dark,  
A hand extended, a simple compass home.

[Chorus-Out — choir-like harmonies, fade to single piano]  
[Chorus] There are really dark moments — I know them,  
[Chorus] Say the name; the night will lose its weight,  
[Chorus] We carry one another’s light when we can,  
[Chorus] You are not alone — you are not alone.
