**🎼 Song 2: “Kept Trying” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “I just kept trying.”

**[Verse 1]**  
The piano plays a minor chord,  
Like the ache I couldn’t name.  
I smiled through the interviews,  
But nothing felt the same.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I kept trying,  
Even when the light grew dim.

**[Chorus]**  
Kept trying, through the tears,  
Kept trying, through the years.  
Every loss carved a space,  
Every hope found its place.

**[Verse 2]**  
Coco came, a light so bright,  
But the shadows still remain.

**[Bridge]**  
I carry them in silence,  
In every refrain.

**[Outro]**  
Kept trying,  
And love remained.
