### Style Descriptions

**200 Character Style**  
Driving pop-rock ballad with fierce vocals, electric guitar swells, and sharp cadence. Honest rhymes like “pain/rain,” “broken/token.” Unapologetic grit, anthem of loss turned into power.

**300 Character Style**  
Song rides a steady drum pulse with piano undercurrent, exploding into guitar-driven choruses. P!nk’s tone—honest, ragged, defiant—delivers lyrics that speak of miscarriage, shame, therapy, and body betrayal. Chorus is bold and anthemic, bridge bends into humor and release, outro leaves strength raw and unvarnished.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
Seventeen cut me open, a loss I couldn’t mend,  
my body broke the promise, the start became the end.  
Carried silence heavy, shame became my skin,  
thought I was the failure, buried deep within.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Every crack, every scar, tried to keep me chained,  
but I learned to sing the truth through the weight of pain.

**[Chorus]**  
Even broken, I’m unbroken, screaming louder than my pain,  
I’ve been shattered, bruised, and spoken, but I rise again.  
I’ll write the ugly pieces, I’ll laugh through what I can,  
Even broken, I’m unbroken—this is who I am.

**[Verse 2]**  
More than once I’ve stumbled, more than once I’ve bled,  
each miscarriage whispered lies inside my head.  
Therapy lit the mirror, showed the ghost I fight,  
turned the blind spots honest, pulled the dark to light.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
So I bleed it on the paper, sing it on the stage,  
own the broken body that once felt like a cage.

**[Chorus]**  
Even broken, I’m unbroken, screaming louder than my pain,  
I’ve been shattered, bruised, and spoken, but I rise again.  
I’ll write the ugly pieces, I’ll laugh through what I can,  
Even broken, I’m unbroken—this is who I am.

**[Bridge]**  
I joke when it’s too heavy, I cry when I can’t cope,  
self-deprecation’s weapon, but the target’s hope.  
I’m not ashamed of bleeding, not ashamed of scars,  
the body that betrayed me still carried who we are.

**[Outro]**  
Even broken, I’m unbroken, my anthem’s not in vain,  
unashamed, alive, outspoken—stronger for the pain.
