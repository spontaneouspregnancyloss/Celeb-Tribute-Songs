## Song Description

“Signed Off” is Lauren’s second SPL-themed track, written from the quiet aftermath of her missed miscarriage. The song explores the invisible grief she carried while returning to work, parenting her daughter, and navigating physical recovery. With poetic phrasing and a forward-moving cadence, the lyrics reflect the surreal experience of being “signed off” from work while emotionally unprepared to re-enter life. The title becomes a metaphor for the temporary pause grief demands, and the quiet strength required to resume. This is a song for those who’ve had to keep going while still healing.

## Lyrics

```
[Intro]  
Signed off for a month,  
But grief doesn’t clock in.  
Iron low, body slow,  
Still learning how to begin.

[Verse 1]  
I couldn’t lift my daughter,  
I couldn’t climb the stairs.  
I smiled through the morning,  
But I wasn’t really there.  
The trauma came in fragments,  
Like glass beneath the skin.  
I wore my work clothes,  
But I didn’t fit in.

[Pre-Chorus]  
They said I’d be fine,  
That time would do its part.  
But time moves differently  
When you’re missing a heart.

[Chorus]  
Signed off, but still aching,  
Signed off, but still awake.  
I carried the silence  
In every breath I’d take.  
Signed off, but still breaking,  
Still learning what to fake.

[Verse 2]  
I answered emails slowly,  
I made the tea too strong.  
I nodded through the meetings,  
But everything felt wrong.  
I held my daughter gently,  
Afraid I’d fall apart.  
She asked me why I cried,  
I said, “I lost a part.”

[Bridge]  
No one saw the absence,  
No one saw the strain.  
I walked through the office  
Like a ghost in the rain.

[Chorus]  
Signed off, but still aching,  
Signed off, but still awake.  
I carried the silence  
In every breath I’d take.  
Signed off, but still breaking,  
Still learning what to fake.

[Outro]  
Signed off for a month,  
But grief doesn’t clock in.  
I’m still healing,  
From where you had been.
