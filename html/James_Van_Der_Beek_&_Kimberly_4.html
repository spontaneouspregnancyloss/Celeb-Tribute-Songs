**🎵 Song 2: _“Shortcut Soul”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
We lit a candle, named a star,  
But the soul we expected didn’t get far.  
A shortcut taken, a path unknown,  
Still we feel you in our home.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It wasn’t time, it wasn’t fate,  
But love arrived, though it came late.

**[Chorus]**  
Shortcut soul, still whole,  
Shortcut soul, still known.  
You didn’t stay, but you were here,  
In every heartbeat, every tear.

**[Verse 2]**  
We grieve in whispers, love out loud,  
We speak your name, we make you proud.

**[Bridge]**  
We take care of each other still,  
Even when the world stands still.

**[Outro]**  
Shortcut soul, you’re part of us,  
Shortcut soul, in love and trust.
