## **Michelle Obama — Draft 1 (Narrative Arc)**

**[Verse 1]**  
A test turned, a flicker of hope,  
“Positive,” it whispered — a door swinging open.  
But a couple of weeks later, the silence fell,  
and I had a miscarriage.

I felt lost, I felt alone,  
like I had failed at something invisible.  
No one told me this was common —  
we sit in our own pain,  
thinking we’re broken.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I didn’t know the language of grief,  
I didn’t know the numbers hidden in the shadows.  
I only knew the emptiness,  
the quiet that followed.

**[Chorus]**  
But my story is not just mine,  
it belongs to so many who never speak.  
The silence weighs heavier than the loss,  
turning sorrow into shame.  
If I break it open, if I name it,  
then maybe someone else won’t feel so alone.

**[Verse 2]**  
I learned that miscarriages are common,  
that the body sometimes says no,  
that it doesn’t mean I am broken.  
Still, I carried the weight in secret,  
while Barack was away,  
giving myself the shots,  
shouldering hope one syringe at a time.

**[Bridge]**  
I thought failure lived in me,  
but the truth is different.  
It’s silence that makes us feel small,  
not the loss itself.

**[Chorus – Repeat]**  
This story is not just mine,  
it belongs to so many who never speak.  
The silence weighs heavier than the loss,  
turning sorrow into shame.  
If I break it open, if I name it,  
then maybe someone else won’t feel so alone.

**[Outro]**  
From lost and alone to speaking aloud,  
the wound became a seed of truth.  
We are not broken.  
We are not alone.
