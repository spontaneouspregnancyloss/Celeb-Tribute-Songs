Lyrics  
**[Verse 1 – R&B Vocalist]**  
I didn’t speak it / not even to the mirror  
The pain was quiet / but it couldn’t be clearer  
I folded into silence / like a note never sent  
A mother with no cradle / a heart slightly bent

**[Pre-Chorus – R&B Vocalist]**  
No one asked / and I let it be  
A storm inside / no eyes could see  
But you stayed close / didn’t ask me to explain  
Just held the hush / and shared the strain

**[Chorus – R&B Vocalist]**  
I didn’t speak it / but you stayed beside the ache  
We leaned on silence / when the words would break  
No one else knew / what we carried that night  
But love stayed with us / through the loss and the fight

**[Rap Interlude – Ludacris]**  
She ain’t say a word, but I felt it in the air  
Pain don’t need a language when it’s everywhere  
I didn’t push, didn’t pry, just stayed in the zone  
Two hearts breaking quietly, but never alone

We prayed in silence, no spotlight, no stage  
Just two souls walking through the same page  
She didn’t want to talk, and I didn’t make her  
But I held her hand, just to brace her

**[Bridge – R&B Vocalist]**  
I didn’t speak it / but I felt it all  
The rise, the fall, the echo in the hall  
You never left me / even when I broke  
You held the silence / like a sacred oath

**[Outro – R&B Vocalist + Ludacris]**  
(Vocalist) Still carried / still real  
(Luda) Still healing / still feel  
(Both) We leaned on silence / and we’re still standing still
