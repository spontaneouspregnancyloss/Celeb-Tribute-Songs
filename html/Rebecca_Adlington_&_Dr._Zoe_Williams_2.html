**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
An intimate folk-ambient ballad, expanding Rebecca’s imagery: anger at her body, swelling after loss, tears, silence. Fuller verses and flowing lines give shape while staying trauma-informed and authentic.

**300 Character Style**  
A more fully realized acoustic-folk ballad. Verses are fleshed out with Rebecca’s embodied experience—her body’s betrayal, her continued pregnancy shape, the ache of holding Harper. Dr. Zoe’s words appear as connective truth about silence. Imagistic but with body, rhythm, and arc.

**Song Description**  
This revision builds on Rebecca Adlington’s words about her 20-week miscarriage, deepening the imagery around her _body_ (“I was angry at my body,” “still looked pregnant,” “my body let me down”), her grief, and the moment of holding Harper. Dr. Zoe Williams’s perspective on silence anchors the bridge. The lyric keeps the vignette style but expands into a fuller, singable piece.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1]  
I trusted this body to carry you through,  
followed the rules, did all I knew.  
Then silence spoke where heartbeat should be,  
and the mirror showed a stranger to me.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I was angry at my body,  
my body let me down.  
Swollen, aching, still I carried  
a loss that made no sound.

[Chorus / Hook]  
I carry you, Harper, in this body—  
broken, swollen, and still yours.  
We held you in our arms that day,  
we’ll hold you in love forevermore.

[Verse 2]  
No symptoms warned, no signal came,  
I kept on breathing, but nothing changed.  
Three days of tears I couldn’t contain,  
grief poured out, a river with your name.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I was angry at my body,  
my body let me down.  
Still round as if you lingered,  
still echo in every sound.

[Chorus / Hook]  
I carry you, Harper, in this body—  
broken, swollen, and still yours.  
We held you in our arms that day,  
we’ll hold you in love forevermore.

[Bridge]  
Dr. Zoe said too often,  
“People get on with it, no one knows.  
They suffer in silence,  
we need to talk, we need to show.”

[Chorus / Hook]  
I carry you, Harper, in this body—  
broken, swollen, and still yours.  
We held you in our arms that day,  
we’ll hold you in love forevermore.

[Outro]  
So if silence weighs heavy,  
I’ll speak your name out loud.  
This body remembers, this body still holds—  
Harper, our angel, our love unbound.
