Song —**1 (Imagistic / Vignette)**  
[Verse 1 — male vocal, soft electronic pad + acoustic guitar]  
Ultrasound light like a small lighthouse, blinking thumbs and hope,  
We hung our plans on the screen like little paper boats,  
And when the current took them quiet, we learned how empty can be,  
The room keeps breathing though the plan has gone.

[Pre-Chorus — distant vocal harmonies, heartbeat percussion]  
You feel that loneliness — it arrives like winter at the door,  
No map, just a low hum where a future used to be.

[Chorus / Hook — warm synth + acoustic blend, vocal doubled]  
[Chorus] It’s a lonely experience — so I’ll speak the name,  
[Chorus] Say the small truth to soften the night,  
[Chorus] If our words build a bridge across that dark,  
[Chorus] Then someone else will know they’re not alone.

[Verse 2 — guitar fingerpicking, gentle piano fills]  
We told the story because someone told us theirs,  
A chain of voices knitting light into the dark,  
That thumb-up on a screen — a quick, absurd delight,  
A tiny yes that echoes in a quiet house.

[Bridge — ambient swell, then stripped to solo guitar]  
When you’re the first to say the thing that hurts,  
You make room for others to follow in,  
A simple line: you are not defective, you are human,  
And love remains, even after the loss.

[Chorus-Out — full arrangement, soft fade]  
[Chorus] It’s a lonely experience — so I’ll speak the name,  
[Chorus] Say the small truth to soften the night,  
[Chorus] If our words build a bridge across that dark,  
[Chorus] Then someone else will know they’re not alone.
