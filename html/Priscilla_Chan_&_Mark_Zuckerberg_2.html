200 Character Style  
Gentle piano-forward chamber pop: intimate female vocal, soft strings, light brushed percussion. Plainspoken lines, warm harmonies, open space for the lyric’s honesty.

300 Character Style  
A restrained, piano-led chamber-pop ballad emphasizing clarity and calm: sparse acoustic textures, subtle strings on the chorus, intimate lead vocal with close mic feel. Emotion arrives in the phrasing — straightforward, compassionate, and unadorned — matching Priscilla’s public, maternal voice.

Song Description  
This song is built from Priscilla Chan’s public, first-person reflections about pregnancy struggles and why she and Mark shared their experience — especially her point that there are dark moments where you feel alone and that sharing helped them see they weren’t alone. I used her own words as the epigraph and paraphrased her public reflections into plain, first-person lyrics. The arrangement chosen (warm chamber-pop) is an inferred fit to her public, composed persona and the intimate, caregiving tone she has used in interviews.

Lyrics — **Draft 1 (Narrative / Timeline)**  
[Verse 1 — female vocal, warm piano, quiet breathy guitar]  
I held the days like paper in my hand,  
One hope folded into another, then slipped away.  
The rooms were quiet, private, full of questions,  
I learned how dark a single silence could feel.

[Pre-Chorus — soft strings enter, vocal close, intimate]  
There were times I thought the world had no mirror,  
Times I thought I had to carry it alone.

[Chorus / Hook — fuller band, intimate harmonies]  
[Chorus] Quiet truth: you are not alone,  
[Chorus] We found others on the road we walked,  
[Chorus] Speaking gave us space to breathe and to grieve,  
[Chorus] Quiet truth: you are not alone.

[Verse 2 — steady piano, subtle percussion]  
We talked and found the shadows were not only ours,  
Three losses learned in the hush before dawn,  
Sharing made the dark less sharp, less private,  
And made room for the small fierce hope we kept.

[Bridge — piano and cello, voice gentle]  
I speak now so someone else won’t think it’s only them,  
There were really dark moments — I will say that out loud,  
We found one another and the world softened,  
And I carry that kindness forward, quietly.

[Chorus-Out — full band, strings lift, fade to piano]  
[Chorus] Quiet truth: you are not alone,  
[Chorus] Let the words be the place where hands can rest,  
[Chorus] In the telling, we will find a softer dawn,  
[Chorus] Quiet truth: you are not alone.
