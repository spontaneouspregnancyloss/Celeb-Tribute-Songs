**🎵 Song 2: _“I Told You”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
The test was faint, the hope was loud,  
But I told you, I wasn’t proud.  
I’ve been here before, too many times,  
Each one a mountain I had to climb.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I told you I couldn’t do this,  
But I still wished for bliss.

**[Chorus]**  
I told you, it’s hit or miss,  
I told you, I ache for this.  
Still I dream, still I try,  
Still I ask the sky why.

**[Verse 2]**  
Miscarriages, each one a song,  
I sing them softly all night long.

**[Bridge]**  
I carry them in every breath,  
In every fear, in every step.

**[Outro]**  
I told you, still strong,  
I told you, still belong.
