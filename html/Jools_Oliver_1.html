**🎵 Song 1: _“Five Little Stars”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Intro]**  
Five little stars in the sky,  
Five little names I never got to try.

**[Verse 1]**  
I had four children, a full house of love,  
But I still reached for stars above.  
I kept it quiet, I felt the guilt,  
Like I was selfish for the life I’d built.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I didn’t tell my mum,  
I didn’t tell my friends.  
I carried the silence,  
To the bitter end.

**[Chorus]**  
Five little stars,  
Still shine in me.  
Five little stars,  
I’ll always see.  
Even when the world says “enough,”  
I still believe in love.

**[Verse 2]**  
One nearly took my life away,  
I bled and prayed I’d stay.  
I stuffed nappies, I called for help,  
I didn’t know how much I felt.

**[Bridge]**  
PTSD and flashbacks come,  
But I speak so others won’t be numb.

**[Outro]**  
Five little stars,  
Still mine.
