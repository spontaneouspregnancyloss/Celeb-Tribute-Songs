Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
Twelve weeks / a quiet line  
No heartbeat / no sign  
I folded the news into silence  
And walked into the day

**Pre-Chorus**  
The office lights were humming  
My smile was practiced, thin  
I didn’t know how to grieve  
So I kept it all within

**Chorus**  
Twelve weeks / and no one saw  
The part of me that broke  
I wore my voice like clothing  
And never once spoke

**Verse 2**  
The coffee steamed beside me  
The emails filled the screen  
But I was somewhere else  
In a place I hadn’t been

**Pre-Chorus**  
I went to work the next day  
Like nothing had gone wrong  
But something left me quietly  
And I’ve carried it so long

**Chorus**  
Twelve weeks / and no one saw  
The part of me that broke  
I wore my voice like clothing  
And never once spoke

**Bridge**  
It felt like I was split in two  
One half here, one half with you  
No name, no cradle, no goodbye  
Just a shadow passing by

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unknown  
A story I call my own
