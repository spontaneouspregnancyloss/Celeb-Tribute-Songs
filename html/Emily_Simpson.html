## [Lyrics]

```lyrics
**[Verse 1]**

I painted dreams on nursery walls,  
Two tiny hearts, I heard their calls.  
But silence came, a thunder crack,  
No lullabies to bring them back.

I smiled through shows, I played the part,  
But grief was dancing in my heart.  
A twin flame lost, a name unsaid,  
A cradle full of tears instead.

---

**[Pre-Chorus]**

I held the air like it was you,  
A ghost in pink, a shade of blue.  
The world moved on, but I stood still,  
A mother‚Äôs ache, a silent will.

---

**[Hook ‚Äì Catchy & Repetitive]**

**Echoes in the frame, I still say your name,**  
**Dancing in the dark, but I‚Äôm not the same.**  
**Heartbeat gone, but love remains,**  
**You‚Äôre the rhythm in my veins.**  
**Echoes in the frame, I still say your name‚Ä¶**  
_(repeat with layered harmonies)_

**[Verse 2]**

I found a way to dream again,  
Through borrowed wombs and borrowed pain.  
A miracle in someone‚Äôs care,  
A child born from a whispered prayer.

But still I light a candle low,  
For those I lost, for what I know.  
That motherhood is not just birth,  
It‚Äôs love that echoes through the earth.

**[Bridge ‚Äì Instrumental with Spoken Word Option]**

[_(]Cello and violin swell, maracas pulse gently]_  
_"To the ones I never held, but always feel‚Äî You made me stronger, even in your silence."_

---

**[Outro ‚Äì Soft Refrain]**

**Echoes in the frame‚Ä¶ I still say your name‚Ä¶**  
**You‚Äôre the rhythm in my veins‚Ä¶**
```
