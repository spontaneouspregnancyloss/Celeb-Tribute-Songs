**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
A heartfelt dueted pop ballad—piano, soft strings, complementary harmonies. Sharpened rhyme patterns like “fail/smile” and “broken/spoken” with natural flow and warm intimacy.

**300 Character Style**  
A duet between Lauren and Nick: her quiet resilience, his grief-filled voice, merging into a nurturing chorus of shared hope. Structured with ABAB rhymes in verses, tighter coupling in pre-chorus, a symmetrical chorus hook, and evocative bridge that balances rhyme and emotional cadence.

**Song Description**  
An imagistic yet narrative hymn drawing solely on Lauren Kitt Carter's and Nick Carter's first-person public statements about miscarriage: Lauren’s shame and resilience; Nick’s heartbreak and longing for “a little sister for Odin”; the surprise of a 1% chance pregnancy. This second song brings their voices together, emphasizing both their individual emotions and shared message of hope.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1 – Lauren]  
I held a shame I thought I couldn’t fight,  
“Supposed to create life” — I lost that night.  
But I learned to step out from grief’s long mile,  
found strength in the quiet after the trial.

[Pre-Chorus – Lauren]  
I never thought another could revive,  
a spark at one percent—I blinked alive.

[Verse 2 – Nick]  
God, give us peace—I was heartbroken so,  
dreamed of her face at three months’ long glow.  
“She was a little sister for Odin,” I told,  
a missing story etched in our soul.

[Pre-Chorus – Nick]  
Grief splintered me, but speaking made me hold,  
hope in the truth, not silence, quiet and cold.

[Chorus – Both]  
Even one percent, love carries us on,  
in quiet loss, a soft light shines on.  
We name her, hold her memory with song,  
in telling the truth, we’re brave and we’re strong.

[Bridge – Both]  
Lauren: I accept what’s beyond control,  
Nick: In our ache we gather what soothes the soul.  
Together: You’re not alone, we survived the night—  
if our words help one soul see dawn’s first light.

[Outro – Both]  
Even one percent, love carries us on—  
we speak of the lost, till silence is gone.
