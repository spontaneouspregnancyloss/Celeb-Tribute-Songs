Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
White walls, no sound  
A name I whispered out loud  
No lullaby, no cry  
Just the hush that filled the sky

**Pre-Chorus**  
I used to get pregnant all the time  
But this one stayed, just not alive  
A son I met in silence  
A love I couldn’t revive

**Chorus**  
The quiet room still echoes  
With the name I gave to you  
George, you were real  
Though the world never knew

**Verse 2**  
They wrapped you in cotton  
I held you like a prayer  
No cameras, no announcements  
Just the weight of empty air

**Pre-Chorus**  
I don’t think it’s generous  
This grief that doesn’t fade  
But it’s the only thing that grew  
From the space you never made

**Chorus**  
The quiet room still echoes  
With the name I gave to you  
George, you were real  
Though the world never knew

**Bridge**  
I see you in the quiet  
In the pause between my songs  
You never cried, but I still hear  
Where your heartbeat should belong

**Outro**  
Still carried, still true  
George, I knew you
