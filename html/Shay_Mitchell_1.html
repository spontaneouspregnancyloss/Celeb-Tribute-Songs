Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Piano-led pop ballad with restrained, compassionate tone. First-person reflections on miscarriage and silence, turning private grief into a gentle call for empathy. No melodrama—clear, grounded, raw.  
300 Character Style  
Intimate, steady ballad: soft piano, light drums, subtle guitar swells. First-person lyrics paraphrase Shay Mitchell’s public words about miscarriage—being blindsided, feeling broken, waiting to share—ending as a quiet plea for compassion and togetherness. Grounded, respectful, non-speculative.

Song Description  
A restrained first-person ballad built only from Shay Mitchell’s own public accounts: her 2019 New Year’s Instagram story about losing “the child of [her] hopes and dreams,” her on-camera reflections in _Almost Ready_ (Episode 1) about being “blindsided” at 14 weeks and feeling “broken,” and her message urging compassion because we don’t know others’ struggles. For musical framing, she has said her go-to listening is ’90s/’00s hip-hop/R&B; this piece keeps a simple pop-ballad feel to honor the sensitivity of the topic.

Lyrics  
[Verse 1]  
New Year’s light and shadow on my screen, I breathe—  
I share a sonogram, a broken heart beneath.  
Last year I said it plainly: I lost what I dreamed,  
The words were heavy, simple, and they stayed with me.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I kept the pictures on my phone and didn’t look,  
Quiet held me while I learned the shape of what it took.

[Chorus]  
Fourteen weeks—blindsided—time fell through my hands,  
I felt broken in my body, trying to stand.  
I’m not asking you for pity, only softer eyes,  
Be gentle with each other; we don’t see all our lives.

[Verse 2]  
It wasn’t planned, but joy arrived and filled the room,  
Then silence came, and all that bright became a bruise.  
I waited to say anything the second time,  
Carried hope and memory, both living in my mind.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I still have early visits saved like little ghosts,  
Not forgotten—just a story that I hold close.

[Chorus]  
Fourteen weeks—blindsided—time fell through my hands,  
I felt broken in my body, trying to stand.  
I’m not asking you for pity, only kinder ground,  
A little grace for what we don’t speak out loud.

[Bridge]  
I didn’t know how often loss could come this way,  
I learned the numbers after, not that day.  
So if my voice can offer anything tonight,  
Let it be permission just to treat each other right.

[Outro]  
I’m speaking now because the silence had its turn—  
We walk together, even when we only learn.
