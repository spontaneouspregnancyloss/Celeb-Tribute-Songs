**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
Piano-anchored, soft pop ballad. First-person, imagery-driven reflections on miscarriage—“blindsided,” “broken,” “standing now.” Quiet, compassionate, and gracefully grounded in Shay’s own voice.  
**300 Character Style**  
A gentle pop ballad with delicate piano and warm atmosphere. First-person, lyrical vignettes drawn from Shay Mitchell’s public words: being “blindsided” at fourteen weeks, feeling “broken,” yet “standing” and choosing to speak. Quiet strength and compassion in every line.

**Song Description**  
This second song takes an imagistic, vignette-style approach: weaving together the emotionally resonant phrases Shay Mitchell used publicly—“blindsided,” “broken,” “standing,” “we don’t see all our lives.” It omits a strict narrative, instead lingering in moments of memory, photographs, and shared humanity. The tone is soft, reflective, grounded in real phrases she’s used, drawn from her New Year’s social-media post and her documentary reflections. No invented scenes, only her words and themes, transformed gently into a lyrical meditation.

**Lyrics**  
[Verse 1]  
Blindsided by fourteen weeks, time slipped past my lips,  
I felt broken—body holding silent eclipses.  
I kept your memory folded in the dawn’s faint light,  
A photograph of hope I held close through the night.

[Pre-Chorus]  
There’s a quiet ache in the spaces unsaid,  
Little echoes in the dark where grace quietly treads.

[Chorus]  
I was broken, but I’m standing now—  
A whisper turned to steady vow.  
Eyes that soften, hearts that understand—  
Let us carry each other, hand in hand.

[Verse 2]  
“Lost the child of hopes and dreams,” I once softly said,  
Words too heavy for the lips that tread.  
In the hush of private evenings, I place my trust,  
In shared silence, in what’s real, not chance or lust.

[Pre-Chorus]  
These gentle traces of what might have been,  
Remain held, quiet, dear, and unseen.

[Chorus]  
I was broken, but I’m standing now—  
A whisper turned to steady vow.  
Eyes that soften, hearts that understand—  
Let us carry each other, hand in hand.

[Bridge]  
If even one voice lifts the hush of grief tonight,  
Let this be a quiet echo of shared light.  
We carry stories we cannot speak aloud,  
But in gentle spaces, our hearts are found.

[Outro]  
I felt broken; quietly, I still stand here.  
Not alone, in whispered love and care.
