**🎼 Song 2: “Nearly Died” _(Vignette Approach)_**

**Epigraph**: “I nearly died.”

**[Verse 1]**  
The room was white and spinning,  
I felt the edge of time.  
They saved me from the silence,  
But couldn’t save what’s mine.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I lived,  
But something stayed behind.

**[Chorus]**  
Nearly died,  
But still alive.  
Nearly lost,  
But still I try.

**[Verse 2]**  
My children ask for more,  
But I just sigh.

**[Bridge]**  
I’m missing someone,  
I can’t describe.

**[Outro]**  
Nearly died,  
Still I cry.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Nearly died / Still I cry”_
