**🎼 Song 1: “Missing My Third” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “I am missing my third.”

**[Verse 1]**  
Two children call me mama,  
But one I never met.  
I nearly died that morning,  
But I’m not done yet.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
They ask me for a baby,  
I smile and change the tone.

**[Chorus]**  
Missing my third,  
Though I never held you.  
Missing your name,  
Though I never knew.  
Missing my third,  
Still loving you.

**[Verse 2]**  
It was a bad experience,  
But love still grew.

**[Bridge]**  
You’re part of me,  
Even if no one knew.

**[Outro]**  
Missing my third,  
Still true.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Missing my third / Still loving you”_
