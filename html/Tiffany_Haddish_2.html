Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Atmospheric R&B/Soul ballad; layered harmonies, reverb-soaked piano, heartbeat kick drum; imagistic, meditative phrasing that circles around recurring motifs of heart, cave, blood, and silence.

300 Character Style  
Moody R&B ballad shaped by imagery: echoes, cavern reverb, soft falsetto layers. Minimalist arrangement: piano, synth pad, faint heartbeat rhythm. Lyrics are imagistic vignettes using Tiffany Haddish’s own metaphors—heart-shaped, cave, wounded animal—focusing on internal landscapes of loss and survival.

Song Description  
This vignette-driven lyric cycle is built only from Tiffany Haddish’s first-person public accounts of pregnancy loss. Primary source material: PEOPLE (Apr 25, 2024) and PEOPLE (Jul 24, 2023, quoting her Washington Post interview).  
Instead of a narrative timeline, the song gathers her most vivid metaphors—“uterus shaped like a heart,” “like a wounded animal… cave,” the recurring “so much blood,” and the privacy of healing. The sonic atmosphere mirrors her themes of solitude, retreat, and restrained hope.

Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
Like a wounded animal, I fold into stone,  
find a cave where no questions can follow.  
Silence wraps me, and I lick my wounds,  
wait for the ache to echo itself out.

[Chorus]  
In the cave of quiet, I keep my truth alive,  
a heart-shaped house that won’t hold,  
blood on the floor where the promise slips,  
it devastates, and I carry what’s left inside.

[Verse 2]  
“This would be my eighth one,” I whisper to air,  
the nurse’s voice breaks the line: “You’re miscarrying now.”  
I don’t know why there’s so much red,  
the tide keeps coming, and I stand still.

[Chorus]  
In the cave of quiet, I keep my truth alive,  
a heart-shaped house that won’t hold,  
blood on the floor where the promise slips,  
it devastates, and I carry what’s left inside.

[Bridge]  
Every time I learn, I change my ways,  
no drink, no smoke, I give it a chance.  
Even when the hope can’t stay,  
I retreat, breathe, and wait again.

[Outro]  
The cave remains, a shelter in grief,  
I heal in quiet, though the loss runs deep.  
A heart-shaped house, empty tonight,  
but I keep walking, I keep the light.
