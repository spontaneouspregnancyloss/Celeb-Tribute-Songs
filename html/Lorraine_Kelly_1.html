Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
Twelve weeks in, then nothing  
No heartbeat, no reply  
I sat in the quiet  
And let the moment pass me by

**Pre-Chorus**  
I went back to work the next day  
Smiled like I was okay  
But I wasn’t really there  
Just moving through the grey

**Chorus**  
The day after / no one knew  
I wore my voice like something new  
It was incredibly lonely  
To carry what no one could view

**Verse 2**  
The cameras rolled, the lights were bright  
I laughed on cue, I held the line  
But inside, I was somewhere else  
In a space I couldn’t define

**Pre-Chorus**  
I didn’t tell a single soul  
Not the crew, not the floor  
I held it like a secret  
Behind a closing door

**Chorus**  
The day after / no one knew  
I wore my voice like something new  
It was incredibly lonely  
To carry what no one could view

**Bridge**  
They say we should talk about it  
But I didn’t know how  
It felt too quiet, too raw  
To speak it out loud

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unknown  
A story I call my own
