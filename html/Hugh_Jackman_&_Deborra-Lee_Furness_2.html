**🎵 Song 2: _“Not Easy”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
Curtains drawn, scripts unread,  
We whispered names inside our heads.  
The stage was set, but we stepped back,  
No spotlight for this heart attack.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It was painful, not easy,  
No lines to memorize.  
Just raw emotion,  
And silent cries.

**[Chorus]**  
Not easy, but we tried,  
Not easy, still we cried.  
We held each other through the storm,  
Even when the world felt torn.

**[Verse 2]**  
We grieved in private,  
But never broke.  
We spoke in glances,  
In every stroke.

**[Bridge]**  
We found our rhythm in the quiet,  
We found our strength in the fall.

**[Outro]**  
Not easy, still we stand,  
Not easy, hand in hand.
