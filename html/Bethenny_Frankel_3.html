Lyrics
**ðŸŽ¶ Draft 2 --- Vignette / Imagistic (with rhyme)**

**Verse 1**
White walls whisper, steady light,\
Time stood still on a sleepless night.\
A fragile hope I couldn't hold,\
A fleeting story left untold.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Life is timing, sharp and kind,\
A truth you face, no pause, rewind.

**Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

**Verse 2**\
Age and numbers marked my years,\
Mixed with laughter, laced with tears.\
I don't regret the path I choose,\
Even love comes dressed as bruise.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Life is timing, sharp and kind,\
A truth you face, no pause, rewind.

**Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.

**Bridge**\
To say it out loud, it makes me whole,\
Honesty speaking what silence stole.\
Not broken, but wiser, I remain,\
Love still lingers after pain.

**Final Chorus**\
Candle burning, faint but clear,\
Love outlasts the loss I fear.\
I move forward, strong and free,\
Still carry that piece of me.
