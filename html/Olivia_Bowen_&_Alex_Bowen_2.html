**Style Descriptions**  
**200 Character Style**  
Dreamlike acoustic-folk piece: short images, sparse rhymes. Built on Olivia’s own words: “completely floored,” “bittersweet,” “absorbed into me,” “forever part of our story.” Grounded, respectful, pared down.

**300 Character Style**  
An imagistic vignette song: gentle guitar, airy vocal lines, whispered percussion. Lyrics mirror Olivia Bowen’s own descriptions—shock, bittersweet grief, vanishing twin absorbed into her body, the permanence of memory. No invented detail; pure echo of her lived words, trauma-informed and restrained.

**Song Description**  
This lyric draws only from Olivia Bowen’s own words about her vanishing twin loss at eight weeks, as shared on _Loose Women_, _Fabulous_ (_The Sun_), and _People_. It uses her phrases—“completely floored,” “bittersweet,” “absorbed into me,” “forever part of our story”—as fragmentary images. Rather than narrative, this version is an imagistic vignette, with atmosphere of quiet remembrance.

**Lyrics**

[Verse 1]  
Completely floored—  
a screen with two lights,  
then silence where one was.  
No bleeding, no clue,  
just gone.

[Chorus / Hook]  
You vanished into me,  
but never away from me.  
You existed. You were loved.  
Forever part of our story.

[Verse 2]  
Bittersweet—  
a joy with a shadow,  
one heartbeat, one whisper.  
Cells folded into my body,  
you live here still.

[Chorus / Hook]  
You vanished into me,  
but never away from me.  
You existed. You were loved.  
Forever part of our story.

[Bridge]  
Therapy in speaking it,  
connection through pain.  
Less alone,  
more together—  
your name carried in silence.

[Outro]  
Not forgotten,  
not erased—  
you are home in me.
