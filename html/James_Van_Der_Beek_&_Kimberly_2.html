### Song Description

This vignette-style lyric for Kimberly Van Der Beek moves away from direct narrative to embrace her **imagistic language** around grief and faith. In her posts and interviews, she has emphasized _threads of connection, unseen strength, rivers of grief, and divine timing_. She also spoke openly about the _non-linear nature of healing_ and her grounding in spiritual practices. This song, therefore, takes an impressionistic form — imagery of weaving, rivers, skies, and threads — reflecting her own vocabulary of faith and resilience. The tone is gentle, trauma-informed, and folk-inspired, mirroring the soothing, holistic sensibility that Kimberly embodies in her public life.

### Lyrics

**Verse 1**  
Threads unravel, threads repair,  
I feel the weight, but You are there.  
Skyline shifting, morning slow,  
Carrying stories only we know.

**Pre-Chorus**  
The river bends, it doesn’t break,  
Washing the ache I cannot shake.

**Chorus (Hook)**  
I’m weaving loss into light,  
A tapestry torn, yet holding tight.  
In threads unseen, I still believe,  
Life gives and takes, but love won’t leave.

**Verse 2**  
Silence speaks in gentle waves,  
Holding the echoes of lives we gave.  
Time’s not linear, grief’s not small,  
Yet grace is steady through it all.

**Pre-Chorus**  
The river bends, it carries me,  
Into the vast eternity.

**Chorus (Hook)**  
I’m weaving loss into light,  
A tapestry torn, yet holding tight.  
In threads unseen, I still believe,  
Life gives and takes, but love won’t leave.

**Bridge**  
Hands I cannot see,  
Lift what’s left in me.  
Faith a fragile flame,  
But it burns just the same.

**Final Chorus**  
I’m weaving loss into light,  
A tapestry torn, yet holding tight.  
In threads unseen, I still believe,  
Life gives and takes, but love won’t leave.

**Outro**  
Threads of heaven, threads of earth,  
Even in loss, love finds its birth.
