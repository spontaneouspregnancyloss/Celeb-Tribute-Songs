**🎼 Song 1: “Didn’t Want Gold” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “I didn’t want gold medals, all I wanted was a baby.”

**[Verse 1]**  
They cheered my name in stadiums,  
But I cried alone at night.  
I didn’t want the medals,  
I just wanted life.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It felt so lonely,  
Like no one saw the fall.

**[Chorus]**  
Didn’t want gold,  
Just a heartbeat to hold.  
Didn’t want fame,  
Just a name to say.

**[Verse 2]**  
Miscarriage, then ectopic pain,  
I felt broken, lost in shame.

**[Bridge]**  
The toughest time I’ve ever known,  
But I’m not alone.

**[Outro]**  
Didn’t want gold,  
Just a soul to call my own.
