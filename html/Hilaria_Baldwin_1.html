**🎵 Song 1: _“Four to Five”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Verse 1]**  
We were halfway there,  
Four months in, I felt you move.  
I whispered names into the air,  
Dreamed of lullabies and baby shoes.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But something shifted in the quiet,  
A silence I couldn’t ignore.  
The doctor’s face said everything,  
And I crumbled to the floor.

**[Chorus]**  
Between four and five, I lost you,  
Though I carried you with pride.  
I gave birth to silence,  
And cried where joy once lied.  
Between four and five,  
I said goodbye.

**[Verse 2]**  
I had to birth you,  
Though you’d already gone.  
My body still prepared,  
But the heartbeat was withdrawn.

**[Bridge]**  
I don’t pretend it’s easy,  
I don’t pretend it’s fine.  
I speak so others know,  
This grief is mine.

**[Outro]**  
Between four and five,  
You were real.  
Between four and five,  
I still feel.
