## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
We had plans for the weekend,  
Balloons and laughter in the air.  
Friday morning felt like magic,  
By night, it wasn’t there.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I smiled through the silence,  
Pretending I was fine.  
But heartbreak doesn’t wait,  
It shows up right on time.

**[Chorus]**  
Friday night, the world went quiet,  
Dreams undone in candlelight.  
I don’t want to fake it anymore,  
This grief is mine, and it’s raw.

**[Verse 2]**  
We were ready to celebrate,  
Now I’m learning how to grieve.  
Behind the smile, I’m breaking,  
But I still believe.

**[Bridge]**  
To anyone who’s felt this ache,  
You’re not alone, I see your face.

**[Outro]**  
Friday night, I lost a part of me,  
But I found the strength to speak.
```
