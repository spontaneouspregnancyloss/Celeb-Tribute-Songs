### Song Description

A deeply personal narrative following Kimberly Van Der Beek’s experiences: violent, near-fatal miscarriages at 17 weeks; the burial of two fetuses—named John and Zachariah—in the “mama plant” that bloomed afterward; the cumulative toll of five miscarriages; her shift into healing—creating rituals, honoring her body, rejecting societal pressures. It ends in a moment of delicate spiritual renewal.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
I stood on the edge—intuition’s trembling call,  
Seventeen weeks of hope, then the hospital,  
I almost lost it—my body breaking apart,  
Two tiny names buried now beneath my heart.  
John and Zachariah, planted in that vine,  
Mama plant blooms—quiet sign.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Five losses in five seasons,  
Two so harsh it altered all my reasons. ([People.com](https://people.com/parents/kimberly-van-der-beek-miscarriage-really-harsh-experience-more-kids/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kimberly Van Der Beek on 'Really Harsh Experiences' with Miscarriage"))

[Chorus]  
But I’m in healing mode,  
Tender with my body, letting go of what I know.  
I made space for rituals, tea and quiet prayer,  
Letting roots find peace down there. ([The Bump](https://www.thebump.com/news/kimberly-van-der-beek-reflects-miscarriage?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kimberly Van Der Beek Reflects on How 5 Miscarriages Changed Her"))

[Verse 2]  
Born five children, held them close in home’s light,  
Yet lost two so fierce it stole my nights,  
So I cradled my breath, grateful and scarred,  
Yet learning how to be soft, step by step, yard by yard. ([People.com](https://people.com/parents/kimberly-van-der-beek-miscarriage-really-harsh-experience-more-kids/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kimberly Van Der Beek on 'Really Harsh Experiences' with Miscarriage"))

[Pre-Chorus]  
Dragging society’s expectations behind,  
I sleep, I rest—give rise to something kind. ([The Bump](https://www.thebump.com/news/kimberly-van-der-beek-reflects-miscarriage?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Kimberly Van Der Beek Reflects on How 5 Miscarriages Changed Her"))

[Chorus]  
Now I’m in healing mode,  
Tender with my body, letting go of what I know.  
Meditation corner, tea ceremony slow,  
Paths of peace I sow.

[Bridge]  
The vine blooms again—life from loss’s ground,  
A spiritual flowering without a sound,  
I feed myself with ritual and care,  
From struggle’s ashes, growth declares.

[Outro]  
Intuition warned me, I almost lost it all—  
But mama plant blooms, and I stand tall.
