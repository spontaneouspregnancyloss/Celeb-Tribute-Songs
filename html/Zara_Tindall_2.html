### Style Descriptions

200 Character Style  
Fingerpicked guitar with airy piano tones; vocals soft, close to the mic. Vignette-like verses flow into a restrained hook, focusing on images of letters, silence, time, and healing.

300 Character Style  
Minimalist acoustic texture: guitar, soft piano, and brushed percussion. Melody drifts with free phrasing, like reading from a private journal. Chorus repeats a single image—letters and doors—symbolizing grief, partner empathy, and gradual healing.

### Song Description

This song uses vignettes rather than narrative: piles of letters, silence that was “too raw,” public eyes knowing too soon, a helpless partner beside her, a late delivery and an early shadow, the sense of a horrible road that time slowly heals. All imagery stems directly from Zara Tindall’s public words, translated into impressionistic fragments.

### Lyrics

Verse 1  
Letters stacked on the table,  
each one a mirror I never asked for.  
The house feels full of voices  
I don’t yet want to hear.

Chorus  
The letters gather like rivers on the floor,  
I step around them, searching for a door.  
Time moves slowly, but it carries me—  
not away, just through.

Verse 2  
There was silence I held like glass,  
too raw to name, too sharp to pass.  
Everyone knew, the world already there,  
while I tried to hide the air.

Chorus  
The letters gather like rivers on the floor,  
I step around them, searching for a door.  
Time moves slowly, but it carries me—  
not away, just through.

Bridge  
He stood beside me, helpless hands,  
hard for the guys too—still we stand.  
One loss delivered, one slipped by fast,  
both shadows stitched into the past.

Outro  
A horrible road, yet somehow kind,  
time’s a great healer, I hear in my mind.  
Family stronger, voices become true—  
I walk these rivers, and time walks too.
