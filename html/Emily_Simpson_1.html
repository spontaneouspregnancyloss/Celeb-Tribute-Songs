## [Lyrics]

```lyrics
**[Verse 1]**

I had a dream with double wings,  
Two little stars, two tiny kings.  
But fate rewrote the lullaby,  
And left me asking, ‚ÄúWhy, oh why?‚Äù

I cried in silence, smiled on cue,  
But every tear was breaking through.  
Still I stood tall, I wore the flame,  
A mother‚Äôs love, it stays the same.

---

**[Pre-Chorus]**

I found my strength in shattered light,  
I danced alone through darkest night.  
But morning came, and with it grace,  
A brand new sun upon my face.

---

**[Hook ‚Äì Catchy & Uplifting]**

**Light after the fall, I rise, I rise,**  
**Dancing through the pain with open skies.**  
**Love never lost, it just changed form,**  
**You‚Äôre the fire that keeps me warm.**  
**Light after the fall‚Ä¶ I rise, I rise!**  
_(repeat with layered harmonies and rhythmic claps)_

---

**[Verse 2]**

A heartbeat born from borrowed time,  
A miracle in perfect rhyme.  
Through someone else, my dream came true,  
But every beat still echoes you.

I hold them close, I hold you too,  
In every laugh, in skies so blue.  
You‚Äôre not forgotten, you‚Äôre not gone,  
You‚Äôre just the rhythm in my song.

---

**[Bridge ‚Äì Dance Break with Spoken Word Option]**

_(Violin and cello swirl with maracas and synths)_  
_"You were here, even if just for a moment. And that moment made me forever more."_

---

**[Outro ‚Äì Refrain with Harmonies]**

**Light after the fall‚Ä¶ I rise, I rise‚Ä¶**  
**You‚Äôre the fire that keeps me warm‚Ä¶**
