**Bethenny Frankel_Lyrics to Song**

**Verse 1**\
Makeup chair, winter light,\
a pulse I thought I'd keep.\
Paper wristband, whispered names,\
I practice how to breathe.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Room goes quiet, gel goes cold,\
someone circles empty space.\
I lift the ceiling with my chest,\
waiting for a sound that doesn't come.

**Chorus**\
There's a hallway where the strong go soft,\
a clinic where the brave go small.\
I sign my name like stitching skin,\
walk out and order something warm.

**Verse 2**\
Relief taps once, guilt holds on,\
I let them in and still feel wrong.\
Ten days later, one word---girl---\
and rain boots multiply by two.

**Bridge**\
I talk to no one, talk to everyone,\
break the pact of staying silent.\
It wasn't on me, I say,\
and still I check my ribs for blame.

**Outro (Hook)**\
I keep my child close and my calendar loose,\
no stopwatch on the heart's repair.\
If life is coming, it will find me---\
door unlocked, a light left there.

> **[Style Sheet (300 characters)]{.mark}**

Atmospheric storytelling ballad blending acoustic pop and theatre.
Female voice, tender with controlled vibrato. Piano and acoustic guitar
weave through verse fragments; subtle strings bloom in choruses.
Spacious pacing, emotional pauses, imagery-driven delivery. Tone:
reflective, compassionate, poetic, cinematic.
