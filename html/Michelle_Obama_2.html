An intimate folk vignette weaving imagery of sinking skies and empty rooms—tracing wordless loss and finding solace in naming the unspoken truth.

**300 Character Style**  
A quiet, imagistic folk-style song. Through sparse metaphor and sensory language, the narrator inhabits the moment of grief, the loneliness of silence. Then in a whispered invitation, she names the loss aloud, drawing others quietly into shared healing.

**Song Description**  
This piece paints stilled images—the empty heartbeat echo, the hush of unrealized joy, the introspection shattering isolation. It captures emotional texture via imagery, and culminates in lifting the silence with spoken truth.

**Lyrics**  
_Verse 1_  
In a room where hope began to bloom,  
A fragile pulse pulsed in longing light,  
Then vanished – leaving only quiet gloom,  
An echo fading into endless night.

_Pre-Chorus_  
I sat in that hush, with sorrow unspoke,  
Its weight inside me, the silence I broke—

_Chorus (Hook)_  
Let us speak the unspoken, so we know we’re not broken,  
Naming loss aloud—our survival lies in the words we’ve spoken.

_Verse 2_  
I thought my body’s stillness meant I’d failed,  
Like I’d crossed a line no one dared to tell,  
But if we open mouths to break the seal,  
We might reclaim the truth that we all feel.

_Bridge_  
There’s healing in the words that rise from pain,  
In shared breath, we mend and speak again.

_Outro_  
Let us speak the unspoken—your voice meets mine,  
In naming grief, together we re-align.
