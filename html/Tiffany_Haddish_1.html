Style Descriptions  
200 Character Style  
Minimal, breathy R&B ballad with intimate verses and a hushed, resilient hook; gentle piano, sparse drums, and warm pads that leave space for confessional phrasing and natural pauses.

300 Character Style  
Restrained, compassionate R&B/Soul ballad: close-mic vocal, piano and soft 808s, brushed percussion. Light/slant rhymes; conversational phrasing. Crescendos only at the hook, then settles back to intimate storytelling aligned to her quoted language.

Lyrics  
[Verse 1]  
I call the nurse—she tells me it’s happening now,  
I count it out, eight, steady on the line.  
I don’t want the chorus of are-you-okays,  
so I get small, more creature than crowd,  
find a cave and tend what no one sees,  
let the phone keep ringing in another room,  
wait out the questions I can’t carry,  
then step back into the day.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Each time I find out, I change my ways—  
no drinking, no smoking—I give it a chance.  
Then the bleeding comes and a word returns,  
and I prepare for the quiet again.

[Chorus]  
A heart-shaped house that won’t hold what I grow,  
I keep the hope I cleared space for.  
I heal in quiet and breathe again;  
it devastates me, and I’m still here.

[Verse 2]  
Some days the pain drops me to the floor,  
first day feels like the devil is real.  
They said endometriosis—layers shaved away;  
hormones make me drowsy, so I move my body more.  
The bleeding runs heavy; the word returns;  
they do the D&C and send me home.  
I mark the cycle shifting, eleven down to five,  
counting new mercies in shorter nights.

[Bridge]  
Every time I learn there’s life in me, I change—  
no smoke, no drink, I give it a chance.  
Even when I’m unsure what I can hold,  
I go back to the quiet and tend what hurts.

[Chorus]  
A heart-shaped house that won’t hold what I grow,  
I keep the hope I cleared space for.  
I heal in quiet and breathe again;  
it devastates me, and I’m still here.
