## Lyrics
```
**[Verse 1]**  
Last November, the world went still,  
A daughter I never got to hold.  
I thought I’d never be okay,  
But grief has ways to unfold.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I started to heal,  
With love and pain side by side.

**[Chorus]**  
I walked through it all,  
Every tear, every fall.  
I’m here, I’m whole,  
Even after it all.

**[Verse 2]**  
Joy didn’t erase the ache,  
But it gave me space to breathe.

**[Bridge]**  
You were real,  
Even if you couldn’t stay.

**[Outro]**  
I walked through it all,  
And I carry you every day.
```
