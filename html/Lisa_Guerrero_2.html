Lyrics  
**Verse 1**  
The lights were steady  
The script was clean  
I stood in heels  
Bleeding between scenes

**Pre-Chorus**  
No one asked  
I didn’t tell  
I was on air  
Inside a private hell

**Chorus**  
On air, off script  
I broke, but didn’t speak  
A loss unfolding quietly  
While I stood there, sleek

**Verse 2**  
The camera blinked  
I held my line  
A story told  
While losing mine

**Pre-Chorus**  
I had to finish the segment  
That’s what I believed  
But something left me silently  
And I never grieved

**Chorus**  
On air, off script  
I broke, but didn’t speak  
A loss unfolding quietly  
While I stood there, sleek

**Bridge**  
They call it strength  
I call it silence  
A moment that rewrote me  
In the absence of guidance

**Outro**  
Still carried / still unseen  
Still part of where I’ve been
