**Lyrics**  
[Verse 1 – Lauren]  
I thought it was shameful—my body meant to create,  
When I couldn’t, I felt I’d failed, but I learned to accept fate.

[Pre-Chorus – Lauren]  
I lived as if I’d never have one more chance,  
Then life surprised me—gave us one last dance.

[Verse 2 – Nick]  
I’m heartbroken—waiting three months to meet her face,  
“She was a little sister for Odin,” gone from our embrace.

[Pre-Chorus – Nick]  
I begged for peace when grief split us in two,  
But telling our truth, we learned we weren’t alone.

[Chorus – Both]  
I carry that loss, but I still carry love,  
I hold her memory, gentle as wings of a dove.  
One percent chance, yet our hearts still believe,  
In hope, in healing, in the love we still weave.

[Bridge – Both]  
Lauren: “Shameful… supposed to create life” lines my silent night.  
Nick: I longed to meet her, imagined her light.  
Together: We share the ache—yet offer this to you:  
You’re not alone—hope lives in what’s true.

[Outro – Both]  
I carry that loss, but I still carry love—  
Her soft echo moves in every quiet hush above.
