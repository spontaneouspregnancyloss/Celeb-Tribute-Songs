Soft piano, intimate vocal, tender lullaby cadence; gentle lift in the chorus; simple, repeating hook that comforts without embellishment; roomy production, hush dynamics, warm harmonies, slow tempo, steady pulse.

300 Character Style  
Piano-led lullaby with close, compassionate vocal. Sparse verses, light/slant rhymes, and a catchy, comforting hook. Subtle pad and heartbeat kick under the chorus. Bridge lowers to a whisper, then blooms into a final, soothing refrain that offers love only after acknowledging shared loss.

Lyrics  
[Verse 1]  
Before you came, we had known a loss,  
Quiet house, a prayer we held across.  
I learned to breathe in seconds long and slow,  
Counting hopes I wasn’t sure would grow.  
At the keys, I spoke the gentlest truth—  
A rainbow rose and carried me to you.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I keep the words as soft as hands,  
I keep the light as small as plans,  
And say what I once needed said:

[Chorus]  
If you know this ache, I’m holding you with love.  
If you’ve walked that night, I’m holding you with love.  
After you understand, I’m reaching out enough—  
If you know this ache, I’m holding you with love.

[Verse 2]  
You’re growing tall, but in my heart you’ll stay  
The sign of color after days of gray.  
I whisper thanks for every breath of you,  
For every prayer we folded into truth.  
And to the ones who hear this piano ring,  
I send the care I wished for everything.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I keep the tone as gentle rain,  
I name the feeling without blame,  
And say what I once needed said:

[Chorus]  
If you know this ache, I’m holding you with love.  
If you’ve walked that night, I’m holding you with love.  
After you understand, I’m reaching out enough—  
If you know this ache, I’m holding you with love.

[Bridge]  
We speak a warning softly first,  
So no one’s pulled by sudden words.  
Then, if you choose to sit and stay,  
I’ll hold your hurt the tender way.

[Outro]  
To everyone who understands this song—  
I’m sending love; may you feel strong.
