### Song Description

This version transforms Savannah Guthrie’s reflections into imagery: fading time, flickering candles of hope, quiet rooms of gratitude. Her words about stopping herself from hoping, self-protection, gratitude, and acceptance form the backbone. Tone: gentle, poetic, but grounded in her own testimony—never speculative.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1 — female vocal, fingerpicked guitar + soft piano]  
Clock hands blurred the years before I noticed,  
Dreams folded into the corners of quiet rooms,  
I set down the weight before it could break me,  
Telling myself it was kindness to stop believing.

[Pre-Chorus — soft strings rising behind piano]  
I whispered to the silence, “It’s okay,”  
Maybe I was never meant to ask for more.

[Chorus / Hook — full vocal, acoustic guitar + light percussion]  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly,  
Grateful for the blessings that already fill my hands,  
Protecting my heart with the words I repeat,  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly.

[Verse 2 — stripped back, piano centered]  
I told myself I wasn’t entitled to another gift,  
That the love I had was enough for a lifetime.  
Gratitude became a soft shield I carried,  
A way to keep the ache from speaking too loudly.

[Bridge — hushed female vocal, piano only, strings swell at close]  
Later I saw the shield for what it was,  
A defense built gently to guard the tender places.  
Still, in the cracks of my careful acceptance,  
A small flame of longing flickered and stayed.

[Chorus-Outro — soaring vocal, guitar + piano + strings, fade gently]  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly,  
Thankful for the light already given to me,  
I cradle it softly, without asking for more,  
Maybe it’s not meant for me—but I’ll hold hope quietly.
