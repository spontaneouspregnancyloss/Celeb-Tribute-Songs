### Lyrics

[Verse 1 — female vocals, gentle piano arpeggio]  
Blue lights flashing through New York streets,  
Hands pressed tight where the silence bleeds.  
Alone in the night with the weight I can’t bear,  
Whispers of love, but no one was there.

[Pre-Chorus — strings enter softly]  
The echo said _scary_, the walls closed in,  
My heart already open, now torn from within.

[Chorus — vocal lift, acoustic guitar joins piano]  
From the silence, from the fall,  
Perspective blooms where shadows call.  
I opened my heart, it shattered apart—  
But stronger I stand, with love at the start.

[Verse 2 — female vocals, gentle guitar picking]  
Small hands waiting at home for the truth,  
A boy’s tender heart broke beneath the roof.  
In the breaking, I found a clearer flame,  
Every loss etches love with a mother’s name.

[Bridge — piano solo, voice intimate]  
A transfusion of night into morning light,  
Breath by breath, I reclaimed my fight.  
Clarity rising in a room once so dim,  
Motherhood’s longing now etched deep within.

[Chorus — fuller arrangement, harmonies build]  
From the silence, from the fall,  
Perspective blooms where shadows call.  
I opened my heart, it shattered apart—  
But stronger I stand, with love at the start.

[Outro — stripped back to piano + voice]  
Blue lights fading, fear drifts away,  
I carry the scar, but it shows me the way.
