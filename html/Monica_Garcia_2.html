**[Verse 1]**  
Cotton candy skies on a magic ride,  
Whispered the secret I could never hide.  
Aries baby, dream so sweet,  
Flying high where the stars all meet.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But the silence hit too soon,  
No heartbeat in the room.  
Held my breath, I lost control,  
Watched a dream let go.

**[Chorus]** _(Hook – dancehall swing)_  
I lost your light in a hurricane,  
They threw their stones, they called me names.  
Said I lied, said I played,  
But inside I broke in waves.  
No one can steal what’s meant to be,  
No one can take God’s plan from me.  
I lost your light in a hurricane…  
But love remains.

**[Verse 2]**  
Forty years, a spark, surprise,  
Brightest flame under TV lights.  
Friends turned cold, the crowd grew loud,  
Mama’s voice just never found.

**[Bridge]** _(dancehall vocal lift)_  
I was breaking under fire,  
Shattered words, the cruelest choir.  
But my faith became my shield,  
And my soul refused to yield.

**[Chorus]**  
I lost your light in a hurricane,  
They threw their stones, they called me names.  
Said I lied, said I played,  
But inside I broke in waves.  
No one can steal what’s meant to be,  
No one can take God’s plan from me.  
I lost your light in a hurricane…  
But love remains.

**[Outro]** _(softer, almost whispered)_  
I walk in grace, not shame,  
In the quiet I reclaim your name.  
You were real, you were mine,  
A heartbeat lost… but love divine.
