**🎵 Song 1: _“28”_**

_(Narrative Arc)_

**[Intro]**  
I was 28,  
Fertile, womanly, full of fate.

**[Verse 1]**  
I got pregnant with joy in my chest,  
I thought this would be the best.  
But quite late, the truth arrived,  
The fetus wouldn’t survive.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I was hospitalized,  
Infection took hold.  
I couldn’t go home,  
I couldn’t be bold.

**[Chorus]**  
28, a nightmare scene,  
28, no in-between.  
I stayed in bed,  
With chili I couldn’t eat,  
But the love was complete.

**[Verse 2]**  
My mother cooked, my husband stayed,  
They set a table, love displayed.  
I couldn’t taste, but I could feel,  
The warmth, the care, the real.

**[Bridge]**  
It was devastating,  
But I healed.  
Through food, through time,  
Through what was revealed.

**[Outro]**  
28, still part of me,  
28, still memory.
