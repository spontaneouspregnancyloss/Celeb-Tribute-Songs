### Lyrics

[Verse 1]  
We were overjoyed, hearts alight,  
counting weeks, dreaming nights.  
Whispers of a name we loved,  
plans drawn in the stars above.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But the heartbeat never came,  
joy slipped into pain.  
In a moment, all undone,  
the brightest light, now gone.

[Chorus]  
Overjoyed, then broken,  
words too heavy left unspoken.  
It hit me harder than I knew,  
grief came rushing, raw and true.

[Verse 2]  
Tears replaced the laughter’s sound,  
we leaned on each other, held our ground.  
In the silence, hand in hand,  
we tried to breathe, to understand.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every day a shifting tide,  
waves that rise, then subside.  
Grieving is not a straight line,  
but you’re beside me all the time.

[Chorus]  
Overjoyed, then broken,  
hearts still fragile, words unspoken.  
We carry sorrow, but we stay,  
leaning on love through each new day.

[Bridge]  
Stories shared become our light,  
lanterns glowing through the night.  
Gratitude and sorrow blend,  
healing circles without end.

[Final Chorus]  
Overjoyed, then broken,  
but our love remains unspoken.  
We carry loss, we carry flame,  
walking forward, not the same.

[Outro]  
In the silence, in the pain,  
we will rise, again, again.
