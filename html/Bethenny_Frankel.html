Lyrics

**Verse 1**\
Forty-one, spotting, a room gone still.\
The word lands hard, I'm told to rest.\
Keep it quiet, keep it small,\
count the hours, breathe through the nausea.

**Pre-Chorus**\
Then a heartbeat like a tiny drum---\
one bright dinner, we let ourselves believe.\
Next day: the shiver, the chair, the blood,\
a cab, a screen, a search gone quiet.

**Chorus**\
I ask the question no one wants to say,\
hear the answer no one wants to hear.\
Hands on my ribs, I try to own the air---\
not my fault, they tell me. I try to believe.

**Verse 2**\
Clinic light, folded linens, paper gown,\
sign the form, count backward, wake to hush.\
We walk outside and order something simple,\
because sometimes grief comes with a table for two.

**Bridge**\
Relief arrives uninvited, brings its cousin, guilt.\
Days later, a call: the chart says "girl."\
I see rain boots by the door, two pairs,\
and the picture breaks me clean in half.

**Chorus/Outro**\
I hold my child, I choose my quiet,\
I loosen my grip on what must be.\
I won't turn life into a try-hard race---\
if it finds me, I'll open the door.

Atmospheric storytelling ballad blending acoustic pop and theatre.
Female voice, tender with controlled vibrato. Piano and acoustic guitar
weave through verse fragments; subtle strings bloom in choruses.
Spacious pacing, emotional pauses, imagery-driven delivery. Tone:
reflective, compassionate, poetic, cinematic.
