Song Description
In this rare male‑perspective SPL Project song, Clay Walker reaches out to fathers walking through miscarriage with their partners—acknowledging the silent, often unspoken burden of helplessness. He offers empathy (“I feel for you”), companionship in grief, permission to voice sorrow, and faith as a shared refuge. Rooted in his own first‑person reflections (“sucks,” faith, “why”), the song seeks to open space for fathers to feel seen and supported.

Lyrics
Verse 1  
I hear your silence in the empty nursery light,  
Your head still ache from hoping things were right.  
You stood strong, held your grief behind an iron gate,  
Not able to do anything… it sucks, I relate.

Pre‑Chorus  
And when your heart gets heavy and your voice goes quiet—  
You’re not alone in feeling lost in this fight.

Chorus  
I’m standing here beside you, Dad, in this shadowed place,  
I feel for you… and for her heart breaking at its pace.  
We didn’t choose this sorrow… but here we stand the same—  
Powerless, grieving, leaning on faith to name the pain.

Verse 2  
I felt the train roll over my family's deepest dream,  
Watched helpless love unravel at the seams.  
Your pain isn’t lesser, just quieter perhaps,  
But saying its name—together—we’ll bridge the gap.

Pre‑Chorus  
And when your faith feels fragile, your 'why?' rises in the night—  
Hold to that question, you don’t have to fight.

Chorus  
I’m standing here beside you, Dad, in this shadowed place,  
I feel for you… and for her heart breaking at its pace.  
We didn’t choose this sorrow… but here we stand the same—  
Powerless, grieving, leaning on faith to name the pain.

Bridge  
I never asked God ‘why’ when life dealt me MS—  
But this question now is ours, held in whispered distress.  
Tell someone you trust—let walls fall, let tears claim their ground—  
In shared grief, a quiet courage is found.

Outro  
So I offer you my presence in your silent, midnight fight,  
A country brother’s hand, turning darkness into light.  
We’ll walk through this together, sharing words unspoken,  
Because even broken hearts can heal when they’re not broken.
