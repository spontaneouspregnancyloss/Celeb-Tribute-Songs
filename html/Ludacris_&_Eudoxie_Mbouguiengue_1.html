Lyrics  
**[Verse 1 – Ludacris]**  
She ain’t say a word, but I saw it in her eyes  
Pain behind the lashes, thunder in disguise  
Tried to hold her hand, but she pulled it back slow  
Said, “I’m fine,” but I knew that was just for show

We lost a heartbeat, but kept it in the dark  
No posts, no press, just a break in the arc  
She was bleeding inside, and I was too  
But I had to be strong, that’s what men do

**[Chorus – Female R&B Vocalist]**  
We leaned on silence / when the words were too much  
Held each other tighter / in the absence of touch  
No one else knew / what we carried that night  
But love stayed with us / through the loss and the fight

**[Verse 2 – Ludacris]**  
I watched her fold into herself, like a letter never sent  
A mother with no cradle, a storm without vent  
I didn’t push, just stayed in the room  
Let the quiet speak louder than any monsoon

We prayed in our own way, no candles, no crowd  
Just two broken people trying to stand proud  
She didn’t want to talk, and I didn’t make her  
But I stayed, every second, just to brace her

**[Chorus – Female R&B Vocalist]**  
We leaned on silence / when the words were too much  
Held each other tighter / in the absence of touch  
No one else knew / what we carried that night  
But love stayed with us / through the loss and the fight

**[Bridge – Female R&B Vocalist]**  
I didn’t speak it, but I felt it all  
The rise, the fall, the echo in the hall  
You never left me, even when I broke  
You held the silence like a sacred oath

**[Outro – Ludacris + R&B Vocalist]**  
(Luda) Still carried, still real  
(Vocalist) Still healing, still feel  
(Both) We leaned on silence / and we’re still standing still
