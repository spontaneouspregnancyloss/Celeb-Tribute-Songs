### Style Descriptions

**200 Character Style**  
An imagistic, alt-rock ballad echoing Megan’s poetic fragments — shadows, silence, ransom, goodbye — layered with sparse piano and raw guitar textures, leaning into her visceral voice of grief.

**300 Character Style**  
Drawn from Megan Fox’s poetry and interviews, this vignette-style ballad builds surreal, fragmented images of grief: silence as armor, shadows at “ten weeks and one day,” ransom for a lost soul. Sparse piano and moody guitars rise into crescendos that capture the rawness of her words.

### Song Description

_Shadows at Ten Weeks_ transforms Megan Fox’s testimony into impressionistic imagery. Instead of narrating events, it uses recurring motifs from her own writing: hands that can’t be held, silence as weight, ransom as plea, goodbye as rupture. The atmosphere is stark, suspended between tenderness and anguish, mirroring her poetic voice.

### Lyrics

**[Verse 1]**  
A hand I can’t hold, a laugh never heard,  
Your outline a shadow, erased by a word.  
Ten weeks and a day, the image remained,  
But silence took over, and nothing was named.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Armor of quiet, walls that confine,  
I carried the absence, I carried the sign.

**[Chorus]**  
The silence is heavy, the silence won’t fade,  
Shadows still linger at ten weeks and a day.  
Goodbye was a whisper, torn from my skin,  
A ransom unanswered for what might have been.

**[Verse 2]**  
I would pay any price, I would give all,  
To ransom the soul I still hear call.  
But the echo is hollow, the answer unclear,  
A shadow that follows, a silence severe.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Armor of quiet, walls that confine,  
I carried the absence, I carried the sign.

**[Chorus]**  
The silence is heavy, the silence won’t fade,  
Shadows still linger at ten weeks and a day.  
Goodbye was a whisper, torn from my skin,  
A ransom unanswered for what might have been.

**[Bridge]**  
“I’ve never known a loss like this in my life,”  
A fracture of joy, a wound cut with a knife.  
Together and separate, the journey unkind,  
Dark corridors linger, no peace left to find.

**[Final Chorus]**  
The silence is heavy, the silence won’t fade,  
Shadows still linger at ten weeks and a day.  
I whispered goodbye, but the silence stayed,  
Shadows still linger at ten weeks and a day.

**[Outro]**  
Ten weeks and a day.  
Still carried.
