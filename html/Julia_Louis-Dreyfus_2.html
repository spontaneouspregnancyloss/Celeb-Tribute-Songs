**🎵 Song 2: _“Chili and Cornbread”_**

_(Vignette Approach)_

**[Verse 1]**  
I couldn’t eat,  
But the smell was sweet.  
Chili in a cast iron pan,  
Cornbread rising, part of the plan.

**[Chorus]**  
Chili and cornbread,  
At the foot of my bed.  
I was broken,  
But love was spread.

**[Verse 2]**  
I was bedridden,  
But not alone.  
My mother’s care,  
My husband’s tone.

**[Bridge]**  
The meal was comfort,  
Though I couldn’t taste.  
It filled the room,  
It filled the space.

**[Outro]**  
Chili and cornbread,  
Still healing me.
