**🎼 Song 1: “Eight or Nine” _(Narrative Arc)_**

**Epigraph**: “I lost track, it’s somewhere eight or nine.”

**[Verse 1]**  
We told the world too soon,  
And watched it fall apart.  
The first one broke me open,  
Left a scar across my heart.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
My body’s been a prisoner,  
Of hope and quiet pain.

**[Chorus]**  
Eight or nine, I lost the count,  
But never lost the flame.  
Every cycle, every doubt,  
Still I rose again.

**[Verse 2]**  
IVF and silent prayers,  
Rooms I never filled.

**[Bridge]**  
I speak so others know,  
This grief is real.

**[Outro]**  
Eight or nine,  
Still I heal.

**Voice**: Female  
**Hook**: _“Eight or nine, I lost the count / But never lost the flame”_
