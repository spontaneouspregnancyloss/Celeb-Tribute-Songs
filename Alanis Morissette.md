  loss-filled ... persevering process" / "tentacles of investigation" /
  "every rabbit hole" / "thickness of my files."

- **Paraphrase:** She always wanted three children, but after her first,
  attempts to expand her family were interrupted by "false starts" and
  miscarriages. She describes intense grief and fear, relentless hope,
  and an exhaustive, multi-angle search for answers (bloodwork, many
  clinicians, surgeries, investigations), joking that doctors commented
  on how thick her medical file became.

**Deliverable D --- Draft 1 (Narrative arc)**

*(Epigraph seeds, not lyrics): "false starts" • "felt so much grief and
fear"* ([SELF](https://www.self.com/story/alanis-morissette))

**Verse 1**\
Between the first and second, we stopped, then started again,\
I kept the wish for three while bracing for the bend,\
Challenges gathered; miscarriages taught me to doubt,\
I said it out loud --- maybe it won't work out,\
Grief sat beside fear; we learned how to share,\
I carried both softly, like air I had to wear.

**Pre-Chorus**\
I chased and I prayed for a pregnancy to stay,\
Every step showing up, whatever the day.

**Chorus**\
We were chasing, showing up, through surprise and devastation,\
A little trust-light flickered in the rain's duration,\
Optimist with tears, but the light kept there,\
Small as a star I could hold in the air.

**Verse 2**\
I sent out investigations with all their reaching threads,\
Down every rabbit hole, through files an inch thick,\
Doctors laughed kindly at the weight of what I'd read,\
From self-help to scripts, to now --- brick by brick,\
Learning and loss braided tight with time,\
Persevering became the meter, the line.

**Bridge**\
Not the ideal path; one loss was a molar,\
The plan went sideways, the seasons grew slower,\
Still, that pilot light kept working in weather,\
Trust as a ember we guarded together.

**Outro**\
So I show up again, in the dark or the clear,\
Chasing, praying, holding space for the fear,\
If the downpour returns, I'll keep the flame near,\
A small steady signal: I'm still here.
