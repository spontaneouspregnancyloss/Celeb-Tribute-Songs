## Lyrics
```
[Intro]  
I woke up bleeding,  
Miles from care.  
No doctor near,  
Just panic in the air.

[Verse 1]  
We were driving through the desert,  
I felt the shift inside.  
A little tissue passed,  
And I knew I couldn’t hide.  
I didn’t know the language,  
Didn’t know the signs.  
Just knew something sacred  
Was slipping through the lines.

[Pre-Chorus]  
My progesterone was nothing,  
My hCG was low.  
I asked what it meant,  
But I didn’t know.

[Chorus]  
There’s no answer to the why,  
No comfort in the cry.  
I held the grief like fire,  
Burning through the sky.  
There’s no answer to the why,  
Just silence when you try.

[Verse 2]  
I took the pills they gave me,  
To help the end begin.  
Four weeks of waiting,  
For what might’ve been.  
I felt guilty, I felt lost,  
I felt terrible for him.  
We were building something fragile,  
On a hope worn thin.

[Bridge]  
I remember asking plainly,  
“Why did this occur?”  
He said, “There’s no answer,”  
And I believed the blur.

[Chorus]  
There’s no answer to the why,  
No comfort in the cry.  
I held the grief like fire,  
Burning through the sky.  
There’s no answer to the why,  
Just silence when you try.

[Outro]  
I woke up bleeding,  
And I’m still asking why.
