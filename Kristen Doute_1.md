## Song Description  
“No Answer to the Why” is Kristen Doute’s first SPL-themed track, drawn from her deeply personal miscarriage experience. The song captures the emotional chaos of discovering she was miscarrying while far from medical help, and the helplessness of hearing that there was no explanation. With ambient guitar and moody synths, the track builds slowly, mirroring Kristen’s emotional unraveling. Her confusion about progesterone and hCG becomes lyrical metaphor, while the chorus centers on the haunting phrase: “There’s no answer to the why.” It’s a song for anyone who’s been left with questions that medicine—and life—can’t answer.

## Lyrics
```
[Intro]  
I woke up bleeding,  
Miles from care.  
No doctor near,  
Just panic in the air.

[Verse 1]  
We were driving through the desert,  
I felt the shift inside.  
A little tissue passed,  
And I knew I couldn’t hide.  
I didn’t know the language,  
Didn’t know the signs.  
Just knew something sacred  
Was slipping through the lines.

[Pre-Chorus]  
My progesterone was nothing,  
My hCG was low.  
I asked what it meant,  
But I didn’t know.

[Chorus]  
There’s no answer to the why,  
No comfort in the cry.  
I held the grief like fire,  
Burning through the sky.  
There’s no answer to the why,  
Just silence when you try.

[Verse 2]  
I took the pills they gave me,  
To help the end begin.  
Four weeks of waiting,  
For what might’ve been.  
I felt guilty, I felt lost,  
I felt terrible for him.  
We were building something fragile,  
On a hope worn thin.

[Bridge]  
I remember asking plainly,  
“Why did this occur?”  
He said, “There’s no answer,”  
And I believed the blur.

[Chorus]  
There’s no answer to the why,  
No comfort in the cry.  
I held the grief like fire,  
Burning through the sky.  
There’s no answer to the why,  
Just silence when you try.

[Outro]  
I woke up bleeding,  
And I’m still asking why.

She experienced a miscarriage at six weeks while out of town with her fiancé. She described the experience as terrifying, confusing, and emotionally overwhelming:

> “I woke up in the morning and I started bleeding… We were nowhere near my doctor… My progesterone was just nothing… I didn’t even know what hCG meant… I remember asking my doctor, ‘Why? What happened?’ And he’s like, ‘This is just one of those things where there is no answer to the why.’” [1](https://people.com/kristen-doute-says-the-hardest-part-after-her-miscarriage-was-dealing-with-the-fact-that-theres-no-f-answer-11708193)
