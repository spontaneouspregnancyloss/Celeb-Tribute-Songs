**Alicia Vikander_Lyrics to Song**

**"The Light Between (Female Vocals)"**

*(Narrative Arc -- Draft 1)*

**\[Epigraph -- Seed Phrase\]**\
*"The film took on a new meaning"*

**\[Verse 1\]**\
I stepped into a story, not knowing it was mine\
Lines on a page, a mother's silent cry\
We filmed the loss, I played the part\
But life would echo back into my heart

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
No script could hold the weight I'd feel\
When fiction blurred with something real

**\[Chorus\]**\
It was extreme, it was pain\
Not just in body, but in name\
I tried to speak, to not pretend\
To let the silence find its end\
If someone's out there feeling this\
Know you're not alone in it

**\[Verse 2\]**\
The lights went down, the cameras rolled\
But off the set, the truth took hold\
I carried hope, then let it go\
No one prepares you for that shadow

**\[Pre-Chorus\]**\
But I won't let it disappear\
The ache deserves to reappear

**\[Chorus\]**\
It was extreme, it was pain\
Not just in body, but in name\
I tried to speak, to not pretend\
To let the silence find its end\
If someone's out there feeling this\
Know you're not alone in it

**\[Bridge\]**\
I found myself inside the frame\
A role that bore my hidden name\
And though the world may never see\
The quiet grief that lives in me

**\[Outro\]**\
So here I am, not whole, not gone\
Still walking through what I leaned on\
The light between what was and is\
Still flickers in the life I miss
