## Lyrics

```
[Intro]  
I asked the question,  
He gave me the truth.  
“There’s no answer to the why,”  
And that’s the hardest part to soothe.

[Verse 1]  
I replayed every moment,  
Every step I took.  
Was it something I missed?  
Was it something I mistook?  
I felt guilty, I felt small,  
Like I’d failed us both.  
I searched for reasons,  
But there was nothing to hold.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I wanted science to save me,  
To give me a name.  
But the silence was louder  
Than the blame.

[Chorus]  
That’s the hardest part,  
No answer, no chart.  
Just a void where truth should be,  
And a wound that won’t let me be.  
That’s the hardest part,  
No reason, no restart.

[Verse 2]  
I smiled when I got pregnant again,  
But it wasn’t the same.  
No rom-com joy,  
Just fear in my frame.  
I waited months to breathe,  
To believe it was real.  
Because the first time broke me,  
In ways I still feel.

[Bridge]  
I asked, “Why?”  
He said, “There’s no reply.”  
And I’ve been living  
With that lullaby.

[Chorus]  
That’s the hardest part,  
No answer, no chart.  
Just a void where truth should be,  
And a wound that won’t let me be.  
That’s the hardest part,  
No reason, no restart.

[Outro]  
I asked the question,  
And I’m still asking why.  
But I’ve learned to live  
With the hardest part inside.
