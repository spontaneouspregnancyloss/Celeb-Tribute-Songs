## Song Description

“The Hardest Part” is Kristen Doute’s second SPL-themed track, written from the emotional fallout of her miscarriage. The song centers on the haunting realization that there’s no answer to the question “Why?”—a truth her doctor told her, and one she struggled to accept. With ambient guitar and layered synths, the track builds around Kristen’s internal dialogue, guilt, and the mental toll of losing a pregnancy without explanation. The chorus echoes her most quoted line: “That’s the hardest part.” This song is a confessional anthem for anyone who’s faced the silence of medical ambiguity and the ache of unanswered grief.

## Lyrics

```
[Intro]  
I asked the question,  
He gave me the truth.  
“There’s no answer to the why,”  
And that’s the hardest part to soothe.

[Verse 1]  
I replayed every moment,  
Every step I took.  
Was it something I missed?  
Was it something I mistook?  
I felt guilty, I felt small,  
Like I’d failed us both.  
I searched for reasons,  
But there was nothing to hold.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I wanted science to save me,  
To give me a name.  
But the silence was louder  
Than the blame.

[Chorus]  
That’s the hardest part,  
No answer, no chart.  
Just a void where truth should be,  
And a wound that won’t let me be.  
That’s the hardest part,  
No reason, no restart.

[Verse 2]  
I smiled when I got pregnant again,  
But it wasn’t the same.  
No rom-com joy,  
Just fear in my frame.  
I waited months to breathe,  
To believe it was real.  
Because the first time broke me,  
In ways I still feel.

[Bridge]  
I asked, “Why?”  
He said, “There’s no reply.”  
And I’ve been living  
With that lullaby.

[Chorus]  
That’s the hardest part,  
No answer, no chart.  
Just a void where truth should be,  
And a wound that won’t let me be.  
That’s the hardest part,  
No reason, no restart.

[Outro]  
I asked the question,  
And I’m still asking why.  
But I’ve learned to live  
With the hardest part inside.
```
