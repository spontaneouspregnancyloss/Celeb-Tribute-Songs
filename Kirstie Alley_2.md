## Lyrics
```
[Intro]  
That was the loss we suffered,  
But I still believe in light.  
There will be babies,  
Even after this night.

[Verse 1]  
We saw the screen,  
But the heartbeat was gone.  
I wasn’t far enough to feel you kick,  
But I still felt you move on.  
The nurse looked down,  
The room went still.  
I held my breath,  
Against my will.

[Pre-Chorus]  
It was more mental than physical,  
But it tore me apart.  
I smiled for him,  
But I broke in my heart.

[Chorus]  
There will be babies,  
I said through the tears.  
There will be laughter,  
In the coming years.  
I won’t let this moment  
Be the end of my song.  
There will be babies,  
Even if it takes long.

[Verse 2]  
He held my hand,  
But I held the hope.  
I told him we’d try again,  
That’s how I coped.  
I wasn’t ready to give up,  
Not on this dream.  
Even if it hurt,  
Even if I screamed.

[Bridge]  
I built a future in my mind,  
With lullabies and names.  
I won’t erase the picture,  
Just because it changed.

[Chorus]  
There will be babies,  
I said through the tears.  
There will be laughter,  
In the coming years.  
I won’t let this moment  
Be the end of my song.  
There will be babies,  
Even if it takes long.

[Outro]  
That was the loss we suffered,  
But I still believe in light.  
There will be babies,  
Even after this night.

The experience is **“more mental than physical”**, and emphasized her **emotional resilience and hope**:

> “That was the loss we suffered. But there will be another try. There will be babies.” [1](https://www.thebump.com/a/celebrity-miscarriages)

This second song will reflect her **determined optimism**, the **emotional toll**, and her **belief in future motherhood**, even amid grief. The genre remains **cinematic adult contemporary**, with a slightly more uplifting arc than the first.
