## Lyrics
```
[Intro]  
I was still pregnant,  
Though the baby was gone.  
My body didn’t know,  
It kept holding on.

[Verse 1]  
Milk came in like a promise,  
But there was no one to feed.  
I wore the weight of silence,  
And the ache I couldn’t heed.  
They said it was over,  
But my body disagreed.  
Nine months of waiting,  
For a child I’d never see.

[Chorus]  
Still pregnant, still grieving,  
Still fat, still believing.  
Still aching in the places  
Where your heartbeat should’ve been.  
Still pregnant, still bleeding,  
Still lost in what could’ve been.

[Verse 2]  
I was told I might never  
Carry life again.  
So I carried the sorrow,  
Like a mother, like a friend.  
I dressed the part,  
But the cradle stayed bare.  
I whispered your name  
To the empty air.

[Bridge]  
No one saw the nursery  
That lived inside my chest.  
No one saw the lullabies  
That never got to rest.

[Chorus]  
Still pregnant, still grieving,  
Still fat, still believing.  
Still aching in the places  
Where your heartbeat should’ve been.  
Still pregnant, still bleeding,  
Still lost in what could’ve been.

[Outro]  
I was still pregnant,  
But you were already gone.  
And I’m still learning  
How to carry on.

> “When the baby was gone, I just didn’t really get over it. Neither did my body. I so thoroughly convinced my body that it was still pregnant after nine months that I had milk coming from my breasts. I was still fat, I was still grieving, and I had just been told it was very possible I would never be able to have children.” [1](https://www.thebump.com/a/celebrity-miscarriages)

Her tone is raw, reflective, and deeply personal. Given her public persona and emotional candor, the most fitting genre is **cinematic adult contemporary** with theatrical phrasing and a piano-led arrangement.
