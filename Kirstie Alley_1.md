## Song Description  
“Still Pregnant” is a deeply personal ballad drawn from Kirstie Alley’s own account of miscarriage. The song explores the surreal aftermath of loss—when the body continues to behave as if pregnant, even after the baby is gone. With haunting piano and ambient strings, the lyrics trace her emotional and physical confusion, grief, and the devastating realization that she may never carry a child. The song’s theatrical structure mirrors Kirstie’s expressive personality, blending vulnerability with cinematic intensity. It’s a tribute to the invisible aftermath of miscarriage and the resilience found in naming the pain.

## Lyrics
```
[Intro]  
I was still pregnant,  
Though the baby was gone.  
My body didn’t know,  
It kept holding on.

[Verse 1]  
Milk came in like a promise,  
But there was no one to feed.  
I wore the weight of silence,  
And the ache I couldn’t heed.  
They said it was over,  
But my body disagreed.  
Nine months of waiting,  
For a child I’d never see.

[Chorus]  
Still pregnant, still grieving,  
Still fat, still believing.  
Still aching in the places  
Where your heartbeat should’ve been.  
Still pregnant, still bleeding,  
Still lost in what could’ve been.

[Verse 2]  
I was told I might never  
Carry life again.  
So I carried the sorrow,  
Like a mother, like a friend.  
I dressed the part,  
But the cradle stayed bare.  
I whispered your name  
To the empty air.

[Bridge]  
No one saw the nursery  
That lived inside my chest.  
No one saw the lullabies  
That never got to rest.

[Chorus]  
Still pregnant, still grieving,  
Still fat, still believing.  
Still aching in the places  
Where your heartbeat should’ve been.  
Still pregnant, still bleeding,  
Still lost in what could’ve been.

[Outro]  
I was still pregnant,  
But you were already gone.  
And I’m still learning  
How to carry on.
```

> “When the baby was gone, I just didn’t really get over it. Neither did my body. I so thoroughly convinced my body that it was still pregnant after nine months that I had milk coming from my breasts. I was still fat, I was still grieving, and I had just been told it was very possible I would never be able to have children.” [1](https://www.thebump.com/a/celebrity-miscarriages)

Her tone is raw, reflective, and deeply personal. Given her public persona and emotional candor, the most fitting genre is **cinematic adult contemporary** with theatrical phrasing and a piano-led arrangement.
